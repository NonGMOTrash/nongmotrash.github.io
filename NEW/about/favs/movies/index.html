				my favorite movie. the plot and characters were interesting, but the acting is just <i>superb</i>.... the tension in these scenes is just so palpable. i felt exhausted after watching this because my heart was racing so much. what really pushed this over the top for me, though, was the film's commentary on perfectionism and being the best. fletcher is one of the most interesting villans in any story i've seen. i still contemplate the conversation he has with andrew in the dinner scene sometimes... if you can't tell, i'm kinda a sucker for themes and motifs in stories and this film dilivers.

				going in, i thought this was going to be about an actual parasite... so needless to say i was definitely taken for a ride watching this absolutely insane movie. there were so many moments where i was just <i>floored</i> at what was happening. it was absolutely hilarious at times (especially the art therapy), but it also definitely has some more depth to it. i really enjoyed the films commentary on class divides, and i thought it was portrayed very well (the 'smell' motif in particular was really memorable).

				everything about this movie is really well done. i found the sentiment really touching, and i thought the way the multiverse / sensory overload was portrayed was very well done.

				alrighty, um, this is obviously the odd one out of the bunch lol. it's pretty out of left field for me as is, given i usually like more "arthouse" type films, not fun summer blockbusters, and also because... well... this movie isn't even considered that good! but, uh, i really liked it :] couldn't even tell you why honestly, i just thought it was really funny and charming.
