				<em>Senpai is an Otokonoko</em><br>
				if one of my irl friends finds this page i bet they will get a good laugh out of this lol. this manga has it's problems but it reaaaaaaaaaally resonated with me, like, a lot. out of everything i've seen / watched / played, i'd say this has probably had the biggest personal impact on me. i relate to makoto a dangerous amount (minus the bisexual part), and in general i thought the characterization of the main trio was like S++++ tier. i enjoy stories that tackle dark subject matter while still being able to maintain a optimisitic tone, and this manga did that very well. especially given how relatable it is to me.... whenever im feeling really hopeless, this is a good comfort read for me (i've read it 4 times now...). also, i love the art in here, it knows exactly when to be detailed and impressively rendered and when to be cutsy and chibi for comedic effect (and efficiency). that said... it isn't perfect. the "rom" part of this romcom is pretty underdeveloped, with <i>multiple</i> different romances being set up and then dropped, which left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths (including mine, but it wasn't the primary reason i read this so it was okay). the pacing also sags a lot in the middle, with volumes 4-7 (i think? can't remember exactly) being pretty whatever for the most part. i haven't watched the anime for this because i have a strong inclination it's gonna suck, but i probably will one day anyways.
