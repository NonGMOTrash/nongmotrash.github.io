					hiiii ‚ÇçÀ∂ ‚Ä¢. ‚Ä¢ ‚ëÖ‚Çé<br>
					i'm an aspiring game devleoper / artist / storyteller / whatever else. i call myself a "jack of all trades" on the homepage for a reason... i wear a lot of hats! i'm also in college. unfortunately, i'm a <underline title="compooter scienceü§ì">CS</underline> major... you better not tell anyone!!! can't have people thinking i'm more antisocial than i already am (·µï-·óú-)<br>

						i may be going to school to <s>go homeless</s> get a boring tech job, but being so real that's not really what i "aspire" to at all. what i <i>really</i> love is making games. scratch was my gateway drug &mdash; i started when i was in 4th grade and haven't looked back. making a popular indie game has kinda been my dream since i was a kid <span style="text-wrap:nowrap">(À∂ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇÀ∂)</span>... that probably won't ever happen, but my <a href="https://youtu.be/05pSG9kZh1g?si=7_gVgMVBD8fkluDR">game development journey</a> is still far from over. i still hope that one day, i can make a really really good RPG!<br><br>

						naturally, i've also taken an interest in art and animation. in fact, i'm actually working towards a minor in animation at my college! (as well as <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox</a> ñ¶π.ñ¶π). i have a soft spot for pixel art and anime style hand drawn animation in particular (<underline title="there's nothing actually wrong with this but i can't help but feel like 'that guy'....... but i like what i like!!">oof</underline>). i feel a little embarrased calling myself an "artist" because i'm not very good <i>yet</i>, but i'm trying to get better! gotta prove i'm not just some CS junkie, hehe.<br><br>
					</p>


					<p>
						i also want to practice <a href="../writing/index.html">writing</a> more (espeically fiction) in the future... i'm really interesting in storytelling but i haven't done it very much yet. additionally, i want to get into music production, in part so i can make music for my games, and also because i think it's pretty cool (‚åê‚ñ†U‚ñ†). these are the two pieces of the puzzle that i haven't really gotten around to yet, but i'm working on it.

						this might shock you, but the person who loves programming, video games, and has their own website does in fact sit at their computer a lot &gt;.&lt; but i do enjoy getting out when i can. in the winter, i like to ski! my parents started me on it when i was 6 or 7... crazy i was even able to ski then. i'm still not that good for how long i've been doing it, i get too scared to hit any jumps or tricks. but i'm at least <i>decent</i> and can do black diamonds. haven't done a double black yet though... one day!

						getting back to the indoorsy stuff, i really like the <underline title="Fighting Game Community">FGC</underline> &mdash; specifically, <i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i>. my friend got me into it by whooping my butt with potemkin at his house one day in 2022 (it was around the time when the game it 1mil sales). in the subsequent weeks and months, i started playing potemkin too as my first main. in the coming months, i eventually settled on bridget (for no particular reason!! [<underline title="i play bridget bc she's rly cute and i wanna be cute ‚∏ù‚∏ù'v'‚∏ù‚∏ù">lie</underline>]). i wouldn't say i'm too amazing, but i've sqeaked into <underline title="(the highest rank currently)">celestial</underline> and i'm at a solid intermediate level. i really enjoy watching the game, and i was lucky enough to attend EVO 2024 with some friends where i got to watch <a href=https://youtu.be/wwUYASA9hc4?si=q9bzWiZn3WLOCVxA">one of my favorite sets ever</a> live, which was an amazing experience.

						waaaaay back in ~2016-18 i played a <i>ton</i> of .io games. for the most part i was mediocre, with one exception: <i>moomoo.io</i>. i had a strategy that consistently allowed me to take over servers within a few hours... it involved playing with two tabs at once, lol. those were the days. but anyways, this was pretty much the first time i had to come up with an alias. i think i went through a bunch of different (very embarrasing) names. i distinctly remember one of them was Qwark. eventually, though, i came to my senses and settled on NonGMOTrash. i didn't choose the name because i dislike GM foods or anything (i've got a mixed stance on them). i just thought it sounded funny, and i was also pretty self degrading at the time. but it's pretty nice! a bit long, but it's very unique (haven't ever had my name taken on anything) and it tends to stand out to people.
