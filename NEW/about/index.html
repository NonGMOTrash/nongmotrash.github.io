					hiiii ‚ÇçÀ∂ ‚Ä¢. ‚Ä¢ ‚ëÖ‚Çé<br>
					i'm an aspiring game devleoper / artist / storyteller / whatever else. i call myself a "jack of all trades" on the homepage for a reason... i wear a lot of hats! i'm also in college. unfortunately, i'm a <span title="compooter scienceü§ì" style="text-decoration:underline">CS</span> major... you better not tell anyone!!! can't have people thinking i'm more antisocial than i already am (·µï-·óú-)<br>
				</p>

				<h1>aspirations</h1>

				<p>
					in all seriousness though i really do enjoy programming, specifically game development. scratch was my gateway drug, i started when i was in like 4th grade and haven't looked back. the vast majority of my projects have, unsuprisingly, been games. making a popular indie game has kinda been my dream since i was a little kid... <span style="text-wrap:nowrap">(À∂ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇÀ∂)</span> that probably won't ever happen, but i still hope that one day, i can make a really really good RPG!<br><br>

					naturally, i've also taken an interest in art and animation. in fact, i'm actually working towards a minor in animation at my college! (while also trying to work through <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox</a> at the same time... soooo much work ñ¶π.ñ¶π) i have a soft spot for pixel art and anime style hand drawn animation in particular (yeeeeeeep). i'm not very good at drawing <i>yet</i>, but i'm trying to get better! gotta prove i'm not just some CS junkie, hehe.<br><br>

					music production will enter the mix as well, because i clearly don't have enough things to learn. but i haven't gotten the chance to explore it much just yet.
				</p>

				<h1>other hobbies</h1>

				<p>
					i enjoy skiing a lot! my parents started me on it when i was i think 6 or 7?? kinda crazy to think about, i can't believe i was even able to ski then... i was like a little gremlin! i feel bad for them because they had to buy me soooo much new gear as i was growing very quickly, but i'm grateful. i'm still not that good tbh, i'm too scared to do any tricks or jumps and my fundamentals are kinda wack (i have a hard time keeping my skiies 100% parallel). but im at least <i>decent</i> and can go down black diamonds... haven't done a double black yet though. one day!<br>

				<h1>about the name...</h1>

				<p>
					<img style="float:right; max-width: 50%" src="moomoo.png">

					waaaaay back in ~2016-18 i played a <i>crap</i> ton of .io games. for the most part i was mediocre, with one exception: <i>moomoo.io</i>. i had a strategy that consistently allowed me to take over servers within a few hours... it involved playing with two tabs at once, lol. those were the days. but anyways, this was pretty much the first time i had to come up with an alias. i think i went through a bunch of different (very embarrasing) names. i distinctly remember one of them was Qwark. eventually, though, i came to my senses and settled on NonGMOTrash. i didn't choose the name because i dislike GM foods or anything (i've got a mixed stance on them). i just thought it sounded funny, and i was also pretty self degrading at the time. but it's pretty nice! a bit long, but it's very unique (haven't ever had my name taken on anything) and it tends to stand out to people.
