					i'm an aspiring game devleoper / artist / storyteller / whatever else. i call myself a "jack of all trades" on the homepage for a reason... i wear a lot of hats! i'm also in college. unfortunately, i'm a <underline title="compooter scienceü§ì">CS</underline> major... you better not tell anyone!!! can't have people thinking i'm more antisocial than i already am (·µï-·óú-)<br>

						i've loved skiing my whole life, i've got a bit of a knack for writing, and i'd like to learn a <underline title="Spanish, then Japanese, then Russian?? all completely different tho lol">language or two</underline> in the future. but the most important hobby to me is making games, and my <a href="https://youtu.be/05pSG9kZh1g?si=7_gVgMVBD8fkluDR">game development journey</a> is far from over. scratch was my gateway drug, i started when i was in like 4th grade and haven't looked back. making a popular indie game has kinda been my dream since i was little <span style="text-wrap:nowrap">(À∂ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇÀ∂)</span>... that probably won't ever happen, but i still hope that one day, i can make a really really good RPG!<br><br>

						naturally, i've also taken an interest in art and animation. in fact, i'm actually working towards a minor in animation at my college! (as well as <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox</a> ñ¶π.ñ¶π). i have a soft spot for pixel art and anime style hand drawn animation in particular (yeeeeeeep). i feel a little embarrased calling myself an "artist" because i'm not very good <i>yet</i>, but i'm trying to get better! gotta prove i'm not just some CS junkie, hehe.<br><br>

						i also want to practice <a href="../writing/index.html">writing</a> (espeically fiction) in the future, as well as music production. these are the two pieces of the puzzle that i haven't really gotten around to yet, but i'm working on it.

						waaaaay back in ~2016-18 i played a <i>ton</i> of .io games. for the most part i was mediocre, with one exception: <i>moomoo.io</i>. i had a strategy that consistently allowed me to take over servers within a few hours... it involved playing with two tabs at once, lol. those were the days. but anyways, this was pretty much the first time i had to come up with an alias. i think i went through a bunch of different (very embarrasing) names. i distinctly remember one of them was Qwark. eventually, though, i came to my senses and settled on NonGMOTrash. i didn't choose the name because i dislike GM foods or anything (i've got a mixed stance on them). i just thought it sounded funny, and i was also pretty self degrading at the time. but it's pretty nice! a bit long, but it's very unique (haven't ever had my name taken on anything) and it tends to stand out to people.
