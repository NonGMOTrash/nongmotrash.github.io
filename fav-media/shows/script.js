			document.getElementById("thoughts").innerHTML = "Paranoia Agent<br>very strange show. i absolutely love the premise but the execution admitedly isn't the best? the first few epsidoes are spot on, but it slows down in the middle and the ending is a bit weird / underwhelming in my opinion. but even if it feels kind of 'bad,' there's a lot about this show that really resonated with me so i feel like it deserves to be included here.";
