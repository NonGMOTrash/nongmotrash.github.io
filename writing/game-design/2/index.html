				these are my <i>extremely</i> long tf2 rebalance suggestions, made mostly during 2021-22 when i was playing quite actively. originally i intended this to just be a funy lil' thing i shared with the friends i played with, but as the changes started adding up, it basically morphed into my pretend master's thesis on multiplayer game design (except, y'know, all in lowercase). there's actually still some more work i was planning to do on it, if you can believe that, but i stopped playing tf2 and thus my interest in continuing this montrosity has fallen off. so, i'd decided i'd just drop it in here and call it done. i'm not sure how much the average person can get from this (nothing. the answers nothing), but if you like tf2, this might be interesting. feel free to use the outline to skip around to a section you're interested in.

				you may have noticed this has been sitting in the scrapbook for a while.<br>
				originally, i was going to release a short story i've been cookin up this month (walk the line), but i haven't worked on it nearly as much as i'd have liked, so it'll have to wait until around christmas. however, i've been trying really hard to have at least SOMETHING i release every month, so this is just sort of an easy thing for november. hopefully i'll have something more substanial to for december!

				one little annoyance - it's all on a google doc rather than on my site. moving all the content into html would have been a massive undertaking, and probably would have resulted in a worse reading experience anyways (no outline). anyway, here it is.
