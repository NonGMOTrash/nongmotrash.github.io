					RUNEGOD
				</a>
				<p class="details">
					a comic artist. i quite like their comic PAENDEMIC despite RUNEGOD's warnings that "THIS IS CRINGE!" - and i have to agree with them that it is <i>extremely</i> slopy in many aspects, espeically in the later half. it kinda gets worse the more you think about it, but still think it some very strong qualities, and i can't deny that i got pretty sucked in reading it. although, i'd imagine RUNEGOD would hope they are better known for anything <i>but</i> PAENDEMIC, heheh. so maybe, for their sake, you should check out some of their other stuff.

					a traditional roguelike with ascii graphics (though there is a tileset you can use). while it is certainly accessible in comparison to it's contemporaries, it's still pretty daunting if you are only used to the modern genre-mashup roguelikes. however, some of the emergent story telling that can happen is pretty impressive. if you want to get into old school roguelikes, this is the game i would point you to.<br>
					the final version from the original creator is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">1.7.5</a>, but the community has continued with bug fixes and improvements through the community edition, which is what i recomend you play.

					not a game, but a minecraft modpack. however, it's so transformative that it really feels like it's own game. the stand out feature is the invasions: waves of mobs will show up and literally break into your base, forcing you to actually consider defense when constructing your home. this pack is considered fairly difficult - i didn't get far in it myself.
