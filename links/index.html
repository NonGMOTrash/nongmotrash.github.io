				<p class="details">
					a traditional roguelike with ascii graphics (though there is a tileset you can use). while it is certainly accessible in comparison to it's contemporaries, it's still pretty daunting if you are only used to the modern genre-mashup roguelikes. however, some of the emergent story telling that can happen is pretty impressive. if you want to get into old school roguelikes, this is the game i would point you to.<br>
					the final version from the original creator is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">1.7.5</a>, but the community has continued with bug fixes and improvements through the community edition, which is what i recomend you play.
