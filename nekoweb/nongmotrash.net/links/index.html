				<b>their site apparantly got hacked, so it's currently down. i have linked to a temporary redirect they made, but do not visit their main site for now</b><br>
				honestly one of the best sites i've ever seen. the creator, 5102, changed the layout obbsessively often but they were all pretty good. they are also a very skilled artist with a very distinctive style!! they were also the world's #1 AI hater, which i totally get, but it also makes it sometimes difficult to see their amazing artwork... they're site has gone through many phases of requiring a password or even going offline for a little, and currently the art is not available on the site which makes me :'( but i like i said, i understand.<br>

				a comic artist. i quite like their comic PAENDEMIC despite RUNEGOD's warnings that "THIS IS CRINGE!" - and i have to agree with them that it is <i>extremely</i> slopy in many aspects, espeically in the later half. it kinda gets worse the more you think about it, but still think it some very strong qualities, and i can't deny that i got pretty sucked in reading it. although, i'd imagine RUNEGOD would hope they are better known for anything <i>but</i> PAENDEMIC, heheh. so maybe, for their sake, you should check out some of their other stuff.

			an interesting contrarian (at least, i think?) take. if you want my opinion on it: <span class="hidden">i don't think i agree with it, as i felt the author was kind of making a strawman argument. "fail faster" does not claim that failure is good, it claims that failure should come sooner rather than later so that it happens when it's cheap and easy to correct, which is actually exactly inline with "taking intelligent risks," not opposing it.</span> still an interesting read though.

				a traditional roguelike with ascii graphics (though there is a tileset you can use). while it is certainly accessible in comparison to it's contemporaries, it's still pretty daunting if you are only used to the modern genre-mashup roguelikes. however, some of the emergent story telling that can happen is pretty impressive. if you want to get into old school roguelikes, this is the game i would point you to.<br>
				the final version from the original creator is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/">1.7.5</a>, but the community has continued with bug fixes and improvements through the community edition, which is what i recomend you play.
