<p>Please, do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>I love studying. It just triggers something satisfying in my brain
that feels like progress, progress that’s greater than anything else I
could be doing in that moment. At the same time, it’s also quite easy.
At least, relatively. Whatever subject you are studying, be it
engineering, art, finance, plumbing, how to <em>rob a bank</em>,
literally anything you can think of essentially boils down to problem
solving. <em>That’s</em> the really hard part. There’s a reason not
everyone can do these things, after all. It takes a whole lot of will
power to make progress in whatever field you are trying to improve at,
because you have to continuously push yourself to solve harder and
harder problems, which your brain probably doesn’t like (at least not in
the moment). However, this is not the only way to learn.</p>
<p>Researching, skimming articles, watching tutorials, digging through
textbooks – these things I’ll call studying – are a rather enticing
alternative. “Studying” probably doesn’t conjure up images of interest
or inquisition, but if it’s a subject you are genuinely interested in
you will find yourself studying without even realizing it (if you have
ever looked at a wiki or a guide for something, you have experienced
this). Undoubtedly, it’s a whole lot easier than actually <em>doing</em>
the thing. Seeing as so many of us struggle with maintaining motivation,
that probably sounds great, like a perfect way to get started.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m here to tell you that that easiness is exactly
what holds you back. I’m here to tell you that what you thought of as
“getting started” might become all you ever do. I’m here to tell you to
please, just <em>stop studying</em> and go <em>try</em>.</p>

Doing</h1>

<p class="sidenote">
	not necessarily indicative of every subject, here's an <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-college-students-often-dont-know-when-theyre-learning/">interesting study</a> i found
</p>

<p>Studying has a hard limit. It can never convey the full extent of how
to do something, and in fact pure study without experience is borderline
useless. If you doubt this, I again ask you to think back to school, and
what you learned. Think (if you can) of something you got high or decent
marks in. You completed all your homework, aced all the tests, and did
everything expected of you. Depending on the class, you might have spent
hundreds of hours studying this subject. And yet, if you had to solve an
actual problem or make a real project using that knowledge you
supposedly learned… Do you <em>really</em> think you could do it? I
can’t answer this question for you, but at least for me and what I’ve
observed of others, the answer is overwhelmingly <em>no.</em> So why is
that?</p>
<p>There’s some aspects of being good at something that simply cannot be
studied. Even reading exactly what needs to be done, down to the finest
detail, is at least one step removed from making the connection in your
own mind and actually executing it. Applying what you know is its own
skill to be honed, and studying does nothing to for you in that regard.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s the problem that you don’t know what you don’t
know, and so there’s some things you would simply never think to study.
No matter how meticulous and thorough you think you’re being, it’s just
impossible to study and solve every roadblock in advance before they
happen. You cannot predict the future. There’s also the inverse of this:
you don’t know what you don’t need. Without experience to color your
perspective, you are likely to waste a <em>ton</em> of time on things
that realistically don’t help you, just as you’ll overlook many things
that do. This goes doubly so for creative endeavors, as those are highly
personal processes. Nobody in the world can say what will work best for
you specifically, you have to discover it yourself by
<em>doing</em>.</p>
<p>You probably already knew everything I just told you, even if you
couldn’t exactly articulate it. “Nothing can prepare you for the real
thing,” so it is often said. But if these limitations I’ve presented are
such common knowledge, why does it not always inform our actions?</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-hell">Tutorial Hell</h1>
<p>This so-called “hell” has become a popular term to describe the cycle
of someone repeatedly studying a subject (often through YouTube videos
or other content continuously being algorithmically recommended to them)
without ever taking steps to get started actually doing the thing they
wanted to do. In a way, this phenomenon is actually kind of amazing,
almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have to tell you that the vast majority of people in
school regard studying as an incredibly exhausting and boring pursuit.
Traditional education struggles <em>so hard</em> to get students to
actually want to learn, and yet here’s a ton of people actually learning
on their own volition! Surely, schools would kill for this.
Unfortunately, I don’t think this is a secret that educators can
harness, as it’s really no secret at all: people like some things, and
they don’t like others. You cannot will yourself to fancy pure
mathematics or the mechanics of writing, and if you don’t, improving at
those things is often going to be excruciating.</p>
<p>But if you <em>do</em> have that interest, though, studying will
almost feel like leisure. Despite what your experience in school may
have led you to conclude, everyone is naturally curious about
<em>something</em>, and when you learn to satisfy that urge, it feels
good. So good that it’s something you’ll find yourself actually wanting
to do, no grades or external incentives required! Far from “hell,”
studying something you genuinely like often feels like coasting along,
no obstacles in your way.</p>
<p>But this rather subductive property of studying that makes it
simultaneously feel both rewarding and easy is what creates tutorial
hell, and makes it so hard to escape. You want to do something, but it’s
hard, so it’s natural to want to spend some time in order to prepare.
You’ll do that hard thing, someday, but not now. As established in the
prior section, this is a lie you are telling yourself. You will never
ever be prepared, no matter how much you study.</p>
<p>So the answer, then, seems simple: just start trying to do that thing
you wanted to do. If it were really that easy though, then tutorial hell
wouldn’t exist. Taking that leap of faith to attempt something tough
feel very arduous, especially at first. Part of this, no doubt, is
because it’s simply easier to continue cruising down tutorial lane
compared to actually taking action. But, I think just that alone
wouldn’t be enough to explain why it feels <em>so</em> brutally hard to
will yourself beyond just studying. There’s a more insidious aspect to
tutorial hell that keeps people trapped.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>Sucking at something can feel pretty rough. There’s this thing that
you really like, and really want to be good at, but you’re really… not.
Of course, things can get better if you can develop the right mindset,
but I think no matter what it’s always going to hurt a little.</p>
<p>But if you’ve studied something a lot, you’re actually setting
yourself up for something far far worse. In the ladder scenario, 
it’s easier remind yourself that you are a beginner and you shouldn’t
have any lofty expectations for what you can accomplish right away. This
is 100% true, whether you have studied or not. But when you’ve spent
dozens, or even hundreds of hours “preparing,” perhaps to the
extent that you feel this is even part of your identity, it becomes a
whole lot harder to tell that to yourself. This same feeling can occur
when you return to something after taking a long break and getting
rusty. Expectations tend to create a lot of guilt and anxiety. When you
think you <em>should</em> be good at something, but aren’t, it can be
downright soul crushing.</p>
<p>The more you study, the higher your expectations rise, and with it,
the fear of disappointment grows to match. This, in turn, makes it less
likely that you will actually take a stab at whatever it is you want to do. Just
the thought of it becomes increasingly dreadful. Studying now serves not
as a tool to further your learning, but as an escape to protect yourself
and avoid facing that fear. Thus, the cycle repeats.</p>
<h1 id="breaking-free">Breaking Free</h1>
<p>I mentioned earlier that there’s some things you simply cannot learn
without experience. This is one of them. It’s easy to read words like
“forgive yourself” or “focus on small improvements,” but really
internalizing those ideas within yourself is a whole different matter
that’s personal to you. The only advice that’s really universal is the
message of this entire article: <em>try</em>.</p>
<p>That said, there is something related that I believe I can help with,
and that’s when and how to study. Because despite all my badmouthing,
studying <em>does</em> have a purpose, even if it can also be extremely
dangerous. I believe that the key to keeping it in check comes down to
one simple rule: <strong>study only what you need, when you need
it.</strong></p>
<p>This is easy to say, but rather difficult to actually hold yourself
to in the age of algorithms constantly bombarding you with content. The
cycle of tutorial hell makes it easy to keep studying long past the
point where it is even remotely practical for you. Speaking personally,
I’ve spent countless hours researching how to market an indie game even
though I <em>know</em> I am years, if not decades off from ever making
something worth marketing in the first place. Staying true to this rule
requires that you be cognizant of the information you take in. Whenever
you see something and think it looks useful, that should be a sign to
step back and realize that it’s probably not (at least, not to you right
now). The goal is to limit your studying to the one time that it is
beneficial: when you have a problem you don’t know how to solve, and you
are actively searching specifically for how to do
something<em>.</em></p>
<p>Because <em>practice</em>, not preparation, is what's ultimately most valuable.
Failing is its own skill, and there's only one way to learn it.<p>
