				<p class="project-description">
					making this site was a great experience overall, but especially after seeing some other people's (better) websites, there's many things i want to improve, so i wanna kinda rebuild a lot of pages to look nicer and have more artwork. of course, i'll ideally need to develop my skills a little before i get to this.

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 8 (november 4th -> now)</b><br>
			<i>in progress</i>
		</p>

		<hr>
		<p class="entry">
			i sort of lost my groove on journaling for weeks 6 & 7, which is why there's been such a huge gap in the logs. but i'm trying to get back into it this week. overall i made some good progress on a secret project, but i didn't end up doing the raylib NEXT jam because i was busy with that, and schoolwork. college has kept me a bit more busy as i have finals coming up. i'll manage though!!!
		</p>

			<b>WEEK 5 (october 14th -> 20th)</b><br>
			i did pretty awful this week. i only worked ONE (1) day.... that's pretty bad. i was supposed to try and make the 'thing of the month' this week but i didn't even start. i think i've gotten maybe a bit too caught up in college life, and i need to try and get back to a consistent daily output. 	
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
		<b>WEEK 4 (october 7th -> 13th)</b><br>
			i feel like i simultaneously worked a decent amount and also got nothing done this week. i feel like it just comes down to working on hard things: i spent a lot of time drawing art for v2 of the website and working on the game, but the truth is i don't know how to use c++ so it's just natural that things are going to take longer. im learning. i could have worked more at times, but honestly i think i'm doing <i>okay</i>. i do need to figure out a thing of the month for october though............... maybe another article, i think one on copyright might be interesting. not 100% sure yet, but in any case i'll try to get that done this week.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 3 (september 30th -> october 6th)</b><br>
			i only worked on project zeta for i think one day???? but it was a very solid day so i guess this is an improvement -.- spending time in the library was definitely useful, i just ended up spending it more on homework and less on the game, sadly.... my college offers a game design course, and i was thinking about adding a minor in it to maybe merge my school studies and independent studies together, but idk. all i can do is keep trying.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>WEEK 2 (september 23rd -> 29th)</b><br>
			overall my productivity this week has been pretty poor due to a combination of homework and parties happening at my dorm. but next week should be much lighter on both so im hoping to make some more progress. aside from just being busy, the library was also closed for most of the weekend, so i couldn't go to it to try and focus like i was planning.<br>
			as for my actual work, what little was done, mostly came done to just inching towards getting a playable version of project zeta. but i do want to emphasize it is <i>small</i>, and i'm still quite a ways off. i only worked 2/7 days //.\\<br>
			overall i've found this 'weekly report' schedule to be a lot less stressful, but i have found myself missing some benefits of the more task oriented system i had before. going forward into the next week, i want to try and set a goal for the beginning of the day and try to meet it.
		</p>

			<b>WEEK 1 (september 17th -> 22nd)</b><br>
			this week was kinda a struggle. i think i only worked 2 -3 days..... i did work a bit more here and there on the other days but it was too short to accomplish anything meaningful. project zeta hasn't really made much progress..... at least i updated the links page on the website lol
			one good thing i did do was set up my notes with obsidian, synced between devices. i think this has been long overdue. i think part of the reason why it feels like i can't remember anything is just that i don't take notes....... so being able to have a good setup for it will help a lot. point in case: one night i had a very vivid dream that i realized was actually a good idea for a setting, and i was able to record it before it was lost. for awhile i've sort of felt like i struggled with "creativity" at times, and i think this will help a lot. 
			i think my lack of productivity mainly came down to just kinda getting distracted by fun stuff... i went home for the weekend, and wanted to spend most of that time with friends and parents so... y'know. it isn't bad, but it might be good to go to the library ocasionally so i can work in a focused session. most of my library time currently is eaten up by homework.
