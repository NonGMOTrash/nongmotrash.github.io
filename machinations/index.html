			<b>FEBURARY 26</b><br>
			today was not a good day. i... well i did <i>try</i> to write, but again, not much done. it was a bit more than previous days but realistically its still basically nothing. idk. i can't tell if im just lazy or stupid or what.. i don't know what to do. i've gotten back into the habit of bypassing the blocker... this entire day i was kind of just trying to forget about my responsibilities, if i'm being honest. im very dissapointed in myself. i honestly feel like im just going through the motions to just have SOMETHING to write here at the end of the day, which i guess is a start, but man... agh!! idk why i can't just write this stupid thing. although it's not just that, doing any work has felt way harder this past week or so. like even doing that page of elipses 2 days ago, which was only 2 hours of work, took SO much mental energy i felt kinda tired afterward. idk why i can't do anything, it really does feel like im cursed. i don't know what to do. tomorrow, though, i'll have a break from writing so i hope maybe i can refresh my mind or something... crap. im really dreading tomorrow, i neglected so much stuff today.. i need to go to sleep, it's way too late.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 25</b><br>
			this was another one of those days where i was like "i had alotta fun :) but i didn't get much done!! D:" ... all i did was start my nekoweb outpost... um... you can see it <a href="https://nongmotrash.nekoweb.org/">here</a>... made it in like 40 mins lol. but yeah, didn't really work on this site as much as i wanted, was supposed to finish the tunes page today... but it can wait. exposing my weird music taste to the world isn't really high priorty. you know what is though!?!??! the GRAND PLAN for next week!!<br>
			- monday: finish outlining chapter 3 (or else). this has beenn reaaaaaaaaally hard for some reason, half laziness and half writer's block, and i really considered just giving up or something but.. no!! i gotta push through!!!<br>
			- tuesday: 1 page of sketching<br>
			- wednesday: outline chapter 4 (final)<br>
			- friday: start writing chapter 1, up to the first scene<br>
			- saturday: another table of elipses for drawabox (agh!!! really hard for some reason hehe..)<br>
			- sunday: finish tunes page + outpost expansion... maybe link on the main site
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 24</b><br>
			did a table of elipses for draw a box today - its so much harder than it looks lol. took like 2 hours ;-; i didn't do anything for walk the line, idk just writers block i guess... regardless, im just going to stick to the original plan for tomorrow.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 23</b><br>
			heya. today was pretty dissapointing; and reading back at the past week or so, it hasn't been the only one. i've begun to exploit the overide on leechblock and i've spent waaaaaaay more time than i should have on youtube today. i did some work on drawabox and the teralite patch but it was definitley kinda a struggle today. to counteract this, i've decided to change how i allocate the social media time: instead of 30 minutes every day (or 90 minutes if it's a weekend), i'm switching to 0 time on everyday but it's completely unblocked friday, serving as my "movie night" sorta. i think this method will be a lot better for two reasons. first, it allows me to watch long form content without cheating the timer, which is what i did today (and previous days, to a lesser extent) and has resulted in me spending too much time on youtube. the second reason is because i feel spending any time on youtube makes me want mooooar and makes me more likely to circumvent the timer that day, so having a clear divide between "it's allowed" or "it isn't" will work better for me, i think. i also want to better manage how i allocate my time to my various projects. with everything i got goin' on, i feel my focus is becoming increasing fractured which is making it harder to actually complete anything. to curve this, i'm going to put the teralite patch on hold because i think having 4 simultaneous projects is just too much. from now on i want to keep it as 1 main project + 2 permanent-ish backburner things. so from now on, i wanna kinda plan out what im going to do each day of the week every sunday. i didn't do this last sunday obviously, so i'm just going to do it now for the remaining two days of the week. both days, i'll have irl stuff i need to do but i should still have plenty of time to work on my projects.<br>
			- satuday: finish the walk the line outline (seriously im just gonna sit there with it open until its done), do a page of a table of elipses for draw a box<br>
			- sunday: finish the tunes page of the website once and for all (it's been really tedius adding all the tracks lol), and add a room or two to the backrooms<br>

			skiing was fun :) didn't get much done today though, although i wasn't planning on much. just drawing. tomorrow: MOAR!!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 21</b><br>
			wasn't a great day, but better. i spend much of the day sleeping since i slept awful last night, aswell as playing undertale yellow which i wouldn't exactly call time "wasted" but it definitely wasn't productive. i did do some good work on the teralite patch though, got the game at least RUNNING (although it crashes once you get to the title screen..). tomorrow im going skiing, so i don't wanna put too much pressure on myself. maybe just some drawing or something?
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 20</b><br>
			ok i desperately need to add reddit to the block list (i now have). wasted like... idk a lot of time. in fact, i wasted so much time that i'm writing this the day after the fact (again!!!!!!) because i procrastinated until like 2 in the morning. did a tincy tiny bit of work on walk the line but i really am kinda at a block. i think i'll work on the teralite patch more today instead, give it a bit of a rest?
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBRUARY 19</b><br>
			didn't do everything i wanted to today, but it wasn't a complete failure either. just kinda scattered. i did a bit more work on the teralite patch - idk why people are having problems building it, it works for me ;-;-;-; but im gonna port it to godot 4. i think it'll only take a few days; i'll just crack it open now and then when i feel like it. i really WANTED to work on walk the line, but idk. just wasn't my day for writing.. also i starting playing undertale yellow today ^(^.^)^
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 18</b><br>
			i was absolutely exhausted again today... just worked on a site a bit, which is not the greatest. however, i did greatly reduce my social media usage this week so hopefully i can keep it up!! after this weekend, i decided it would be a good idea to set a timer to saturday sunday aswell, i made it 90 minutes instead of the 30 for week days which i think is reasonable. tomorrow i'll be free though (finally!!), so i wanna make that teralite patch and do some drawing, and also get outline another chapter of walk the line. not sure if i'll make the feb 23 deadline but i'll try to atleast fully write another chapter by then.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 17</b><br>
			worked a little bit on the teralite patch, but mostly on the website. the links are updated & ranked by quality now.. anyways im tiiiired
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 16</b><br>
			i'm writing this the day after again aggggghhh!! however, i have a very good excuse: i was sleepy. seriously tho i was downloading something big and i was like "ahh okay im just gonna lay down for a minute while that happens.." and then i woke up at 2:20 in the morning lolol. i love hanging out with friends but my social bandwidth is kinda low so it takes a lot out of me. i did get a little bit of stuff done; mainly, i realized that you can edit videos within youtube to make cuts, which i used to remove a bunch of blank video that i accidentally added to the end of the guilty gear and the calcuator vidoes... really nice that i can do that without reuploading!! i also am considering doing another SMALL patch for teralite. i really don't wanna focus more on making NEW stuff but i do think it could benefit from just a sliiiiiiiiiiight bit of polish, and more importantly, better "documentation" if you wanna call it that. i've had many people tell me they downloaded it on github and can't export it... works on my machineTM!!! seriously though, i wanna try to fix this.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 15</b><br>
			today was a good day! i did some drawing while streaming it to some friends :3 was pretty fun. i did spend too much time playing clash royale i think (i am addicted to playing all goblins) but i set the timer from 45 minutes -> 25, which i think should help curve it. leechblock is also working pretty well i think... i can't just autopilot during my free time anymore!! also also, i worked on walk the line a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitle bit, i coulda done better but overall im feeling pretty happy with today :)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 14</b><br>
			again, i'm a bit dissapointed with what i got done today, although i don't wanna be too harsh because i am getting better. i did, however spend a lot of time playing guilty gear which i kind of regret (just not a great day for it, i needed to get rolling today) and i also spent too much time fiddling with leechblock, because it wasn't working how i intended... but i fixed it (it was just me being an idiot). basically i have it configured to only allow me 30 minutes on youtube / twitter per day. i definitely still felt the pull today, like agggggh what do i do now that content machine is gone??? but i think if i keep this up i can hopefully break my addiction. originally i was going to have everything be unrestricted for weekends, but honestly i might limit it to 90 minutes or something. as for what i actually got done: worked more on the walk the line outline. still only 2/4 chapters OUTLINED, and i still need to write all of them... :( however, i should have some more time to write soon (i understand the problem is mainly that i need to MAKE more time for it, but still) so im hoping i can still get the 2nd draft done and ready for beta readers by my feburary 23 goal. tomorrow i wanna outline chapter 3 and maybe also do some drawing :3
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 13</b><br>
			pretty bad day if i'm being honest. i was feeling extremely tired cus i haven't been getting enough sleep, which i sort of used as an excuse to procrastinate all day. i estimate i probably watched at least 4 hours of youtube... i was so desperate i even played clash royale not with friends. i really wanted to get a chapter or 2 of the outline done today, but i barely did anything. my unproductivity today was the tipping point, though, to finally look into a website blocker thingy that doesn't suck. i've tried an extension in the past, can't remember the name rn, but it kinda sucked and the timeframes were straight up bugged as far as i can tell. this one i found now, leechblock, limits my time on youtube and twitter (the biggest culprits) during mon-fri. basically i only get 15 minutes every 2 hours (can stack though, but i think that's okay), otherwise they redirect me <a href="../countdown/index.html">here</a>
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 12</b><br>
			did another page of ghosted plains, and i actually improved quite a bit compared to the first time.. but i had a lot of work to do today, so i didn't have time for much else. im sleepy, it's 1:20
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 11</b><br>
			i kind of failed again... i don't really have as much to say as last time, i'm just really not the best at this.... but for the 19239th time, i don't wanna strike a balance between apathy and self loathing, so i'm trying to keep my head in it. speaking "positively," i did keep technically keep my streak for 22 days instead of just 15, and i also recovered out of the slump much faster (5 days -> 2)... so i guess i am slowly improving, even if it doesn't feel like it. also i <i>did</i> do some good stuff, such as actually being proactive about finishing my project for feburary early instead of rushing out something at the last minute. so that's good. but you know what's also good? not failing!!!!! so what could i have done better? well last time i sort of talked about how i procrastinated too much, putting off irl work until it was too late which then impacted my ability to work on my own projects. and i will say i think i've gotten a BIT better (keyword: bit), but it's still a problem. however, i've come to realize that this problem exists on a micro-day by day scale aswell. when i get home i usually don't do anything productive for HOURS which is really bad. it tends to put me in difficult situations where i'm like "ok i can either work on my game, work on that important stuff i've been putting off, or sleep good tonight" when realisitcally i could have EASILY done all three. idk. i guess when i get home my brain just wants to deactivate and go social media brainrot; not the best habit to have. so ima curve that. but how?? well, basically in these logs i want to hone in more on <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> i actually did the work that i did, and make a greater effort to notice it and try to improve by habits. so instead of just casually dropping "o yeah i did some ghosted lines at 1:30 lol" i wanna be like, "agh im glad i did something today but i really shouldn't have stayed up so late >:(((" y'know what i mean? so: starting with today, i basically did some work on the website, which i know is kinda like bruh that's easy sauce, but it actually was important as the tunes page has been broken for like 2 weeks lol. so i actually fixed it, and got a youtube music player working (took i think 2ish hours?) which i'm really happy with. previously i was gonna stream it from google drive, but as of like 2 weeks ago they changed it somehow so you can't hotlink stuff (i don't really understand the specifics beyond "it no worky"). i think it was actually kind of a blessing in disguise though, as a youtube player is honestly just better. though, there's one caveot: some videos won't play in the embeded player, only when they're actually on the website! kinda annoying, but i guess i can just find alternate uploads for those songs. but that can wait. oh but yeah, i actually did around when i got home from skiing OH YEAH DID I MENTION I WENT SKIING TODAY?? snow as actually.. present! amazing.. but anyways, i didn't procrastinate until super late at night. yahoo! however.. i am pretty behind on my irl stuff. it's definitely better than before but still bad. im working on it.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 8</b><br>
			i finally started getting back to work on walk the line again today! a week or so ago, i was telling a friend about my struggles with writing, well, anything... and they asked me "do you know roughly how the story is gonna go?" at the time i said yes, but thinking about it more, i realized i really only had a <i>very</i> vague outline in my head, so i decided to start making an outline. i wanted to do it all today, but as is to be expected at this point, it was unexpectedly difficult to write. i did tackle some interesting challenges such as coming up with some more place names and such and sort of planning out the 4 chapters on a VERY basic level, but only chapter 1 is really properly outlined. like all in all i only wrote ~500 words which... agh!! i just think a lot i guess. will try to finish the outline tomorrow!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 7</b><br>
			spent all day working on irl stuff...... it's 2 in the morning now. i also spent like 30 minutes trying to figure out how to play music from google drive only to realize you CAN'T as of like january 11th... bruh. anyways i really need to sleep bye
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 6</b><br>
			im so tired my vision is a bit blurry... i was already behind on sleep so i probably shouldn't have stayed up late. but i finished the video!! worked onn it ALL day lolol... problem is im behind on irl stuff.... crappp. it'll be fine :) i do need some time for it though. so TOMORROW: only 30 minutes of drawing or something easier, and spend the rest of the day on real life (big sad) and then after that i go back to walk the line (big happy)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 5</b><br>
			didn't get a ton done today! it was a combination of procrastination and some less than ideal irl circumstances... but i still did work on the video a bit! i think i can still finish by tomorrow..
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 4</b><br>
			aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh im writing a day late again.. but i have a good excuse!!! internet was out :( although in hinesight i realized i coulda just written it offline and then pushed it to the repo later. but it's okay, i made up for it by actually being productive for once! worked on the video all day for like 5-6 hours i think hehe.. it's not done yet, but it's close. i think i'll be able to finish it today (on the 5th). and to top it off, i also did a page of ghosted plains for drawabox (at like 1:30 in the morning). anyways i need to go and get SERIOUS!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 3</b><br>
			can't believe it's already the 3rd! though i guess that isn't that long. did good work on the video today, although it's taking longer than i expected, only ~1/3rd done. so, i'm gonna extend the release window to feb 5-6. i also wanna do a little work on this website, mainly fixing the music page (scm player -> streaming thru google drive [against tos lol]) and updating the links page, along with some irl stuff. i look forward to it!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 2</b><br>
			i feel asleep reading a book and woke up at 2:30 in the morning... whoops! i did work on the video some though. not a lot, but some. i want to finnish it tomorrow, procrastinated a little too much today
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 1</b><br>
			i didn't write yesterday AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! (it's feb 2 now) i've got to stop this. it's occured to me that the value of these entries deminishes quite a bit if i write them the day after because i can only really write about what i'm feeling when i'm feeling it. the days i have been skipped are usually becasue im very busy with other irl stuff and don't finish until past midnight, so im like, "hmmmmm do i really want to boot up my computer and write this when i could just sleep and do it tomorrow?" <i>yes!!</i> yes i do, you dumb dumb! anyways, on to what i actually did yesterday: i did actually work on my projects (although 99% of the day was taken up by a headache + irl stuff), although it was basically just updating the news section of the website along with the thing of the month (not sure it even took 30 minutes?? whatever). again, i don't want to use easy peasy website work as a crutch to pracrastinate on the hard stuff, but i was pretty busy so i guess it's not the worst. on a day like today though (feb 2), i wanna get back to the gamedev journey video!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 31</b><br>
				i didn't write yesterday (again..) cus i was TIRED and didn't want to stay up even later. spent the day mostly doing IRL stuff, and i also recorded and made the <a href="https://youtu.be/kJQkWVQl6Q4?si=HsoFp6jY_ICCn-A5">calculator video</a> in like 30 minutes lol. i wanted to get something more substantial out this month but i but it didn't really go as well as i was hoping due to the reasons i described in the jan 21 entry. still though, i did get into a fairly consistent groove for a bit with doing atleast SOMETHING everyday, albeit not as much as i want. my immediete plan is to put more work into my irl business (i don't want to get stuck in a cycle of getting behind), and i wanna crank out the gamedev video by feb 2-3 hopefully, then get back to walk the line and ACTUALLY WRITE. i've found it very difficult to actually get words on the page, i'm very very afraid of writing something bad even though that's the whole point of a first draft. i need to just let go and write <i>something</i>, then fix it later.<br>
				as for stuff i wanna change: #1) only work on this website (save for these status updates) on the weekends. i think working on this website, while cool, should be a SIDE PROJECT and i've kinda been using it to procrastinate from the other, harder stuff i wanna do, so it's sort of become a crutch with regardes to the "30 mins a day" promise. #2) i wanna not drop a single day next month. january, while dissapointing, was ultimately the first month i really tried to actually push myself to get things done in quite awhile, and i did <i>okay</i> all things considered (my brain rot) but it's ultimately a learning experience. so to prove that i actually have indeed learned, i need to step it up for feburary and get some things done!! specifically: the game dev journey video, walk the line second draft, then i'll try to start on the rage game. also, i've decided that i just want to finish the 2ND DRAFT of walk the line before getting back to game dev -- i think giving it some time to sit without me looking at it will help me comeback with a fresher perspective (+ the feedback!!) and make it better. i also want to get back to games like nOW!! also, i mentioned in an earlier entry that i wanted to do a "state of the trash" post every month, but i think im gonna make that just once a year instead (prob on my birthday). mainly writing about my work EVERY DAY makes a wrapup like that somewhat redundant, and i'm not really active enough to justify doing one every single month. anywho, back to work!!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 30</b><br>
			so, i spent all of today recording clips for the video -- my gamedev journey so far -- but i've barely even started editing! and considering im gonna cover like 36 games in the video, it's clearly not going to be ready before january is over. not to mention, there's some important irl stuff i've been procrastinating on that i <i>reaaaaaaaally</i> need to do... so plan is: tomorrow, make a quick video (i've got one i can make in like 20 mins lol) and take care of my irl stuff. THEN finish the big gamedev video, THEN get back to walk the line. oh, and i've got to squeeze some drawing in there too.. wish me luck
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 29</b><br>
			i'm actually writing this on the 30th because today i was super tired and really needed to just get some sleep. literally all i did today (in my own time i mean) was archive a bunch of scratch projects -- with the video coming out soon-ish (see tomorrow) i didn't really wanna have it hanging around anymore, mainly because my username is my real name + my area code, lolol. so i'm going to delete my account, but before i did i wanted to archive everything.

			<b>JANUARY 27</b><br>
			just did a bit of drawing today. was planning to do more but ehgh. lazy... i did enjoy today though. stayed up super late watching frosty faustings for guilty gear strive.. was really fun to watch. was not expecting that pocket sin from umisho lol. i'm a bit worried about what i'm gonna do for a video: i can't really do a GGST clip dumb because i play on ps4 and the recording quality is pretty bad. im thinking instead i might do a showcase video showing how my games have progressed over the past 7/8 years

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 26</b><br>
			did some more work on walk the line... writing was extremely slow, as always, but it's coming along. a lot of the """work""" happened in my head, and i think i've got a much better idea of where the story is going now.. but i gotta actually, y'know, write. it's hard :( very good experience though. also, the end of january is coming up soon and i want something cool to showcase for this month. i'm thinking i might make a GGST clip dump or something (recording quality from my ps4 is doodoo though). i also want to do a "state of the trash" wrap-up every month that's a bit more formal, summarizing what i did (and didn't!!) do this month and my plans for next month. i'll probably just put those on this page.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 25</b><br>
			i worked a <i>little</i> on walk the line but not as much as i should have. bad work ethic... but i'm - get this - i'm working on it!!! yeah. overall, pretty uneventful day, but it's a good babystep.

			i spent today struggling with getting music playing for the tunes page... i thought it would be an easy little "extra" i could add real quick, but it's ended up being one of the more complicated pages on the site. however, i <i>gotta</i> get working on walk the line again, i haven't touched it in over a month!!! so for the rest of january, i've decided i'm not gonna work on this site at all! just the story and also a bit of drawabox :3 also, i've noticed myself slowly slipping back into the habbit of youtube binging and twitter scrolling.. wasn't too terrible today, but i definitely want to be more disciplined in the future. i'm stupid enough as is - i don't need more distractions.

			history repeats: today was another good day, spent time with friends!! but... i didn't start on walk the line like i wnated too >.< spending time with friends is great and i really do cherish it BUT it has kinda ate up my time these past few days, hehe. worth it though. still, i did do the ghosted lines excercise, and i did conjure up some IDEAS for the story. i understand that conjuring is not writing but again, baby steps. i'll work on it.<br>
			ALSO: i forgot to commit the changes to the website yesterday, but i did write them at the time.

			<b>JANUARY 22</b><br>
			today was a super good day!!!!! but... didn't have much time to work on projects. i feel a little stupid for being all "okay time to fix things!!!" yesterday and then being busy, but realistically, today was just too jam packed to really do all that much. still though, i did work on the music catelogue a <i>little</i> bit. tomorrow should be more free though, so i wanna really delve into the story for a few hours and also do the ghosted lines excercise for drawabox.

			<b>JANUARY 21</b><br>
			aw man... i kinda.. failed...it's been 5 days!! oops. i do feel pretty bad that i was only able to stick to my resolution for 16 days (technically i have spent ~25% of this year failing), and i don't wanna downplay it too much. not being able to stay focused on what is, realistically, a fairly easy task for even 1 month is.. not the best. no matter what way you slice it, i'm just not the game dev i used to be. but being all "oooo no i faaaaaaaaaailed :(" is not a good way to look at things either. even if my brain really is just <i>that</i> messed up and i just suck at doing anything, and honestly think that's not far from the truth, i still need to be looking for how to improve. so even though i technically """failed""" i'm not gonna give up.<br>
			instead, i'm gonna try to realistically evaluate what went wrong and how i can fix it. firstly, i need to better balance my IRL business and be more proactive with getting it taken care of. specifically, i've often told myself "well im really behind on this thing and that, but i worked on programming today so it's :D" which... is not <i>wrong</i>, but it's not right either. putting off my other work will usually cause it to pile up to a breaking point where i have to crunch and finish a TON of stuff right before a deadline, which ultimately hurts productivity on my personal projects, too. as much as i'd love to just be like "alright, screw this stuff i don't care about, 100% gamedev time >:)," the reality is that's just not in the cards. it might never be. so i just need to learn to balance these things, and maybe try to appreciate the IRL things i get done a little more rather than just being like "ughhhh i coulda been working on the game (or whatever it is) in that time!!!"<br>
			the second problem is, i think, the pirate software game jam. not that there's anything wrong with it, <i>i'm</i> the problem really, but i think i have a lot more growing to do before i can do a game jam longer than like 2 days. i'm trying very very hard to turn things around, but it's undeniable that my subconcious is still in the mindset of "i've already failed, so why even try." a (relatively) long, timed game jam is really bad for me right now because it legitimizes that train of thought in my mind - i really have wasted half of my available time already, so i should just give up so i don't have to think about it. i know this is a problem i need to directly face eventually, but i grow in baby steps. i need to learn to work with some softer, self imposed deadlines first.<br>
			woah... that's a lot! i have a rough plan for how to move forward, but first: i gotta talk about what i did <i>today</i>! it was actually quite a good day (in terms of productivity. but i legit barely left my room so... yeah. not the best), i worked on the website a lot! looking at it you might be like "really? it kinda looks the same :|" but trust me i did a lot! started cleaning up lots of small problems, rewrote some little things, drew some graphics that were previously just generic gifs, and i started on a page with all my favorite music! i still didn't get nearly as much done as i was hoping (i wanted to FINISH the music page AND revamp the scrapbook -> a gallary..), but i put in a lot of effort so i can't really be mad at myself. just how it is, i'll get more productive with practice. i also did some 50% drawing today... currently at a grand total of 4 pages for drawabox!!! wow... that's kinda sucks! but again, baby steps. <i>speaking</i> of baby steps, my plan moving forward: i wanna try to take a bit of a break from game dev and focus on walk the line. having a big unfinished story sitting around has been bothering me, so i wanna clear it off my plate before i get back to games. when i do, i think i'll make a super simple platforming rage game. i want to make something with charm since all my previous games pretty much have beene extremely dry, like 100% focused on the mechanics, which there's nothing wrong with but.. i really wanna make something with heart, you know? but that's a ways off, i suspect finishing the story will be quite the hurdle. but i will have something really good to show for it once it's done!! and of course, i've also wanna work on drawabox and this website periodically. phew! that was a lot of writing. wish me luck :3

			i skipped yesterday because i was feeling extremely anxious... still wish i would have done something but. whatever.<br>
			today was productive... just not on the game. was busy with irl stuff. i wanna do better, but i don't wanna beat myself up over it. just being conscience of it is a good first step i think. anyways im sleepy
		</p>

			<b>JANUARY 16TH</b><br>
			aaaaaaaa i'm not doing to good at this! still didn't start on the game......<br>
			okay i don't wanna doom and gloom though. #1) did work on the website (restored cbox, i'll never betray you again), and #2) i have an idea. i'm gonna NOT use youtube or twitter during the weekdays AT ALL. gonna get that website blocker extension on my computer and setup stuff on my phone (idk app timers!??! idk)... i neeeeeeeeeeeed it. procrastination will kill me. speaking of.. i wanted to do some more drawabox today and i even read the lesson on ghosting lines, but it's reaaaaaaaaaally late and, um, there's something else i need to do also. so it can wait!! i need sleep
		</p>

			<b>JANUARY 15TH</b><br>
			i was feeling extremely anxious today (sort of oscillating in intensity) and spent way too much time on youtube trying to escape reality... i have calmed down a bit in the last few hours though, and did some work rewriting the about me page on this site, as well as updating some social media profiles (technically ""marketing?"" whatever). i also cleared out 1000+ emails today... really gotta stop letting those pile up. good thing 99% of it is unimportant lol. still, i didn't get too much done today. i don't wanna guilt trip myslef too much but overall this weekend has not been that great, both in terms of productivity and just personal enjoyment. i wanna try to rectify that in the future. tomorrow i'll start on the jam game a little, though i'll be busy with some other stuff. i'm thinking my original concept for a turn based game will be waaaaaaay too ambitious, so i'm thinkin' i'll redesign it into a top down shooter while keeping the core concept. i'll try to get basic moving at least, hopefully shooting.<br>
			also, i feel that i'm juggling too many projects at once. i haven't worked on walk the line in a while so i'm gonna put it on hiatus until the game jam is over, and then really focus on it for a week or two.

			<b>JANUARY 14TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on the jam game today, but i don't have much of an excuse this time. just wasn't feeling it. i think i'm going to take a sort of "break" from the game for the rest of this weekend (including monday which i have off)... as i talked about in my "why i suck at getting anything done" article, i don't want to feel like im behind and transform this into a source of internal guilt and shame. logically this is a meaningless gesture that just delays the project another day, but contextualizing it in my mind this way will really help me. at least i hope. writing these updates also helps a lot in the sense that i can recognize patterns / pitfalls more easily, and seeing them in front of me so clearly makes it easier to deal with them. but aside from all THAT, i worked on drawabox today! superimposed lines are finished :3 tomorrow i wanna actually draw THREE pages instead of just one. crazy, right?!? i could probably also work on walk the line a bit, i don't wanna leave it sittin' for too long.

			i made bridget jumper today. yahoo!! really not that amazing as you can tell but its a cute little project. i'm quite happy. next up: i've gotta get rollin on the pirate software game jam!!! it actually started TODAY, not tomorrow, i didn't realize! it's two weeks though so i've got some time. wish me luck :)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 11TH</b><br>
			had a very fun day today but i was honestly exhausted by the time i got home, so i didn't end up working on the bridget jumper again. i know i can still finish it (can honestly be made in a couple hours), so that'll wait for tomorrow. i wasn't planning to get too much done today due to fun times, so it's to be expected.<br>
			still, i did manage to do a sketch page today! paradoxically it looks bad, but i like looking at it. i drawabox is definitely a side project but i wanna up the anti on it a <i>little</i> bit, especially on days like today where my brain is really not in a problem solving sort of mood.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 10TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on bridget jumper at ALL today... and my deadline is friday!!!!!!! ahhhhhh
			i shouldn't be procrastinating this much but i still think i can do it, it's a VERY simple meme game lol. still, i did work on the website a little today updating the links page and stuff, but i gotta get on it.
			to accomplish this, im gonna try a new challenge: no twitter, youtube, or reddit until the weekend. wish me luck!
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 9TH</b><br>
			shoulda done a little more workin and a little less youtube, but it's okay. worked more on bridget jumper... got hung up for a really long time on window scaling, which is all i ended up doing today :/ i remember it took my a while learning the first time, too, so i shouldn't be too harsh on myself. actually now that im looking at the time i did do an okay 1.5 hours so i guess that's not the worst, but i know i can to better!!!! >:)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 8TH</b><br>
			i didn't realize until now, but there had been an issue with uploading the changes to git so this hasn't been uploaded for a few days. whoops!!! also... i was a day behind?!?!?! guess i skipped a day..? i can't believe it, i <i>swear</i> i wrote one every day but i can't seem to find anything missing in past commits..... i think what happened is that i accidentally wrote one in the wrong spot (not at the top), and in moving it i accidentally deleted one of the logs. maybe. regardless, i'll be more careful in the future >.<<br>
			<b>EDIT:</b> okay the problem was actually just the date on my computer was set one day forward (it messed up from when i booted into linux hehe...). as for what i ACTUALLY did today, i worked on the website for a good few hours! i fixed the chatbox (cbox -> chatango) and expanded the backrooms. yahoo!<br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 7TH</b><br>
			i felt unassually sad today, although i cheered up after going to a friends house c: as is propetually the case, i didn't get quite as much done as i was hoping... whatever!!!!! today i figured out how to "fix" environment variables with an autoexec script for powershell. the documentation is kinda terrible (no mention that i have to set a PATH and the actual variable!?!?!??!), but whatever... i managed, and i also got raylib compiling on windows again! yahoo! i've got a pretty funny (and easy) game idea hehe<br>
			but what took up most of my time today was just reorganizing my files (finally banished onedrive), and re-setting up some old applications i used to have on my old computer (im just gonna use notepad++ for a text editor, using vim on windows is a miserable experience i give up)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 6TH</b><br>
			okay somethings gotta change. i said i was gonna work on something eles today, but im STILL in the linux mines trying to get things to work. both becasue of how much of a pain it's been and becasue im really not doing as much as i should be. im just gonna bite the bullet and work on windows for at LEAST the rest of this month - i've got an idea to fix environment variables: an autoexec powershell script!! should probably work...<br>
			(i technically did do a LITTLE bit of drawabox, but it was just rewatching the 50% rule because i forgot the guidelines. doens't really count).<br>
			also, i need to stop playin' guilty gear for a bit. i feel like im slowly becoming more hot-headed over time because im like "im playing a lot, i should be good!!!" kind of like im trying to compensate or something, and its making the game less fun and distracting me from my stuffffffffff. gr. also pirate software gamejam is next week oh god. i am not ready...<br>
			plan for tomorrow: make bridget jumper. or else.<br>
			(also also i REALLY need to fix my sleep schedule its 1:39 rn aaaaaaaa)

			<b>JANUARY 5th</b><br>
			all i worked on today was trying to set up linux mint, and MAN has it been a pain!! booting was pretty easy, but it's stuck in a super low 4:3 resolution and i can't change it ("unknown display"). gahhh! i guess this technically counts as working on a project cus its my "dev environment," but i think tomorrow i should take a break, maybe do some work on this website and walk the line.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 4TH</b><br>
			you know my sleep schedule is bad when it's the next day already by that time im writing this lol. didn't get as much done today as i would have liked, i kinda procrastinated until an hour before midnight (played don't starve for the first time)... but anyways, today i restarted on the drawabox lessons! i tried the course like 6 months ago but only did 5 or so pages. im choosing to start over since i did so little it didn't really stick.. it shouldn't take too long to make up, anyways. i did a page of super imposed lines! also, i didn't buy that usb flash drive but i found an old 32gb SD card, so i could probably just boot linux from that. it'll have to wait til tomorrow though.

			<b>JANUARY 3RD</b><br>
			<img src="jan3.png"><br>
			i made a lil' game today! the setup was super jank (for some reaosn linux mint wasn't working for awhile (i think i gave the VM too much memory??) AND build-essential still couldn't install. i think the iso i got has a different repository or something.. anyways, i went back to pop os since it's giving me less problems so far (although i prefer the windows style UI of mint. idk). i actually figured out how to build raylib - i was doing everything right except my makefile. i still don't know how to use make for this, but i realized using the "simplest possible build script" from the raylib wiki was pretty easy (just a 1 line bash file), so i did that and it worked!!! then i spent like 20 minutes making a veeeery simple clicker game.<br>
			holy crap i forgot how """strings""" and pointers work... but it was still pretty easy thanks to TextFormat(). still, i gotta relearn pointers.<br>
			tomorrow i wanna: 1) investigate a 3rd distro. i like the UI of mint but it's givin' me problems so idk (maybe im just an idiot) 2) get a good USB flash drive to boot from and that also has decent capacity (like 128gb or something). 3) start making a jumper game (like the chrome dinosaur game)

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 2ND</b><br>
			only worked about ~30 minutes today. i spent some more time looking into linux figuring out if i should duelboot on a single drive (i came to the conclusion that it's probably fine with a modern UEFI instead of a BIOS, should prevent windows update from messing up the partitions), but i need a usb drive to boot from. the one i have is only 16gb which isn't enough for linux mint :( (and it's really slow. probably like over 15 years old lol).<br>
			as for the work i actually did get done... well i started over since (this time with linux mint) im pretty sure i was doing everything wrong, and... can't fetch build-essential from the server!! im not sure what to do about that, but it didn't happen yesterday so i assume its cus the package servers are down? i could install git and neovim just fine though.. idk i'll try in a bit tomorrow. but yeah, trying to boot linux mint and troubleshooting that was literally all i did today. oh well<br>
			also, skiing kinda sucked >.<
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 1ST</b><br>
			didn't get as much done as i was hoping. there was sort of a shift in plans - i finally cracked and decided to start trying out linux after i tried AGAIN to get environment variables in windows 11 to work for like 1.5 hours, to no avail (seriously i have probably wasted like 5 hours total on this). so for the last hour-ish, i ran pop os in virtualbox and did all my work in there. i accidentally set it to scale mode and couldn't figure out how to unset it, so it was really strecthed lol. i downloaded and compiled raylib, but i couldn't figure out how to compile my c code, it kept saying all the raylib functions were missing so there must have been some issue with linking. i have no idea how c works lol. despite this, im still feeling alright... i'll probably keep working in a VM til' i finish this little game. i should probably duelboot linux and windows, using windows for gaming and linux for everything else, but that'll have to wait.<br>
			going skiing tommorrow (the snow season SUCKS this year, nothing til JANUARY!??!?!), so im not sure how much i'll get done... i'll do at least a little bit though!

			<b>DECEMBER 31, 2023</b><br>
			the new year technically hasn't started yet, but i wanna start the tradition. today i mainly worked on this website for ~2-3 hours i think, mainly focused on adding the new blog that i wrote yesterday along with the new machinations page (and updating the thing of the month, of course). tomorrow i'm going to try to get a super simple c dev environment setup with raylib + make, and make a super simple game, like a clicker or something. i also need to fix my vim config, syntax highlighting won't work for some reason .-.<br>
			wish me luck for the new year!
