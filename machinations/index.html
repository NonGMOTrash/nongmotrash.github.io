		<h1>daily log</h1>

		<p>for context, read <a href="../writing/4/index.html">this</a>.<br>
		tldr: i've kinda been stuck in a rut, and this log is my attempt to dig myself out.</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 28</b><br>
			started planning the video a tiny bit but its not enough. i have the worst work ethic ever. i need to sleep
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 27</b><br>
			just did a bit of drawing today. was planning to do more but ehgh. lazy... i did enjoy today though. stayed up super late watching frosty faustings for guilty gear strive.. was really fun to watch. was not expecting that pocket sin from umisho lol. i'm a bit worried about what i'm gonna do for a video: i can't really do a GGST clip dumb because i play on ps4 and the recording quality is pretty bad. im thinking instead i might do a showcase video showing how my games have progressed over the past 7/8 years

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 26</b><br>
			did some more work on walk the line... writing was extremely slow, as always, but it's coming along. a lot of the """work""" happened in my head, and i think i've got a much better idea of where the story is going now.. but i gotta actually, y'know, write. it's hard :( very good experience though. also, the end of january is coming up soon and i want something cool to showcase for this month. i'm thinking i might make a GGST clip dump or something (recording quality from my ps4 is doodoo though). i also want to do a "state of the trash" wrap-up every month that's a bit more formal, summarizing what i did (and didn't!!) do this month and my plans for next month. i'll probably just put those on this page.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 25</b><br>
			i worked a <i>little</i> on walk the line but not as much as i should have. bad work ethic... but i'm - get this - i'm working on it!!! yeah. overall, pretty uneventful day, but it's a good babystep.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 24</b><br>
			i spent today struggling with getting music playing for the tunes page... i thought it would be an easy little "extra" i could add real quick, but it's ended up being one of the more complicated pages on the site. however, i <i>gotta</i> get working on walk the line again, i haven't touched it in over a month!!! so for the rest of january, i've decided i'm not gonna work on this site at all! just the story and also a bit of drawabox :3 also, i've noticed myself slowly slipping back into the habbit of youtube binging and twitter scrolling.. wasn't too terrible today, but i definitely want to be more disciplined in the future. i'm stupid enough as is - i don't need more distractions.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 23</b><br>
			history repeats: today was another good day, spent time with friends!! but... i didn't start on walk the line like i wnated too >.< spending time with friends is great and i really do cherish it BUT it has kinda ate up my time these past few days, hehe. worth it though. still, i did do the ghosted lines excercise, and i did conjure up some IDEAS for the story. i understand that conjuring is not writing but again, baby steps. i'll work on it.<br>
			ALSO: i forgot to commit the changes to the website yesterday, but i did write them at the time.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 22</b><br>
			today was a super good day!!!!! but... didn't have much time to work on projects. i feel a little stupid for being all "okay time to fix things!!!" yesterday and then being busy, but realistically, today was just too jam packed to really do all that much. still though, i did work on the music catelogue a <i>little</i> bit. tomorrow should be more free though, so i wanna really delve into the story for a few hours and also do the ghosted lines excercise for drawabox.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 21</b><br>
			aw man... i kinda.. failed...it's been 5 days!! oops. i do feel pretty bad that i was only able to stick to my resolution for 16 days (technically i have spent ~25% of this year failing), and i don't wanna downplay it too much. not being able to stay focused on what is, realistically, a fairly easy task for even 1 month is.. not the best. no matter what way you slice it, i'm just not the game dev i used to be. but being all "oooo no i faaaaaaaaaailed :(" is not a good way to look at things either. even if my brain really is just <i>that</i> messed up and i just suck at doing anything, and honestly think that's not far from the truth, i still need to be looking for how to improve. so even though i technically """failed""" i'm not gonna give up.<br>
			instead, i'm gonna try to realistically evaluate what went wrong and how i can fix it. firstly, i need to better balance my IRL business and be more proactive with getting it taken care of. specifically, i've often told myself "well im really behind on this thing and that, but i worked on programming today so it's :D" which... is not <i>wrong</i>, but it's not right either. putting off my other work will usually cause it to pile up to a breaking point where i have to crunch and finish a TON of stuff right before a deadline, which ultimately hurts productivity on my personal projects, too. as much as i'd love to just be like "alright, screw this stuff i don't care about, 100% gamedev time >:)," the reality is that's just not in the cards. it might never be. so i just need to learn to balance these things, and maybe try to appreciate the IRL things i get done a little more rather than just being like "ughhhh i coulda been working on the game (or whatever it is) in that time!!!"<br>
			the second problem is, i think, the pirate software game jam. not that there's anything wrong with it, <i>i'm</i> the problem really, but i think i have a lot more growing to do before i can do a game jam longer than like 2 days. i'm trying very very hard to turn things around, but it's undeniable that my subconcious is still in the mindset of "i've already failed, so why even try." a (relatively) long, timed game jam is really bad for me right now because it legitimizes that train of thought in my mind - i really have wasted half of my available time already, so i should just give up so i don't have to think about it. i know this is a problem i need to directly face eventually, but i grow in baby steps. i need to learn to work with some softer, self imposed deadlines first.<br>
			woah... that's a lot! i have a rough plan for how to move forward, but first: i gotta talk about what i did <i>today</i>! it was actually quite a good day (in terms of productivity. but i legit barely left my room so... yeah. not the best), i worked on the website a lot! looking at it you might be like "really? it kinda looks the same :|" but trust me i did a lot! started cleaning up lots of small problems, rewrote some little things, drew some graphics that were previously just generic gifs, and i started on a page with all my favorite music! i still didn't get nearly as much done as i was hoping (i wanted to FINISH the music page AND revamp the scrapbook -> a gallary..), but i put in a lot of effort so i can't really be mad at myself. just how it is, i'll get more productive with practice. i also did some 50% drawing today... currently at a grand total of 4 pages for drawabox!!! wow... that's kinda sucks! but again, baby steps. <i>speaking</i> of baby steps, my plan moving forward: i wanna try to take a bit of a break from game dev and focus on walk the line. having a big unfinished story sitting around has been bothering me, so i wanna clear it off my plate before i get back to games. when i do, i think i'll make a super simple platforming rage game. i want to make something with charm since all my previous games pretty much have beene extremely dry, like 100% focused on the mechanics, which there's nothing wrong with but.. i really wanna make something with heart, you know? but that's a ways off, i suspect finishing the story will be quite the hurdle. but i will have something really good to show for it once it's done!! and of course, i've also wanna work on drawabox and this website periodically. phew! that was a lot of writing. wish me luck :3
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 18TH</b><br>
			i skipped yesterday because i was feeling extremely anxious... still wish i would have done something but. whatever.<br>
			today was productive... just not on the game. was busy with irl stuff. i wanna do better, but i don't wanna beat myself up over it. just being conscience of it is a good first step i think. anyways im sleepy
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 16TH</b><br>
			aaaaaaaa i'm not doing to good at this! still didn't start on the game......<br>
			okay i don't wanna doom and gloom though. #1) did work on the website (restored cbox, i'll never betray you again), and #2) i have an idea. i'm gonna NOT use youtube or twitter during the weekdays AT ALL. gonna get that website blocker extension on my computer and setup stuff on my phone (idk app timers!??! idk)... i neeeeeeeeeeeed it. procrastination will kill me. speaking of.. i wanted to do some more drawabox today and i even read the lesson on ghosting lines, but it's reaaaaaaaaaally late and, um, there's something else i need to do also. so it can wait!! i need sleep
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 15TH</b><br>
			i was feeling extremely anxious today (sort of oscillating in intensity) and spent way too much time on youtube trying to escape reality... i have calmed down a bit in the last few hours though, and did some work rewriting the about me page on this site, as well as updating some social media profiles (technically ""marketing?"" whatever). i also cleared out 1000+ emails today... really gotta stop letting those pile up. good thing 99% of it is unimportant lol. still, i didn't get too much done today. i don't wanna guilt trip myslef too much but overall this weekend has not been that great, both in terms of productivity and just personal enjoyment. i wanna try to rectify that in the future. tomorrow i'll start on the jam game a little, though i'll be busy with some other stuff. i'm thinking my original concept for a turn based game will be waaaaaaay too ambitious, so i'm thinkin' i'll redesign it into a top down shooter while keeping the core concept. i'll try to get basic moving at least, hopefully shooting.<br>
			also, i feel that i'm juggling too many projects at once. i haven't worked on walk the line in a while so i'm gonna put it on hiatus until the game jam is over, and then really focus on it for a week or two.
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 14TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on the jam game today, but i don't have much of an excuse this time. just wasn't feeling it. i think i'm going to take a sort of "break" from the game for the rest of this weekend (including monday which i have off)... as i talked about in my "why i suck at getting anything done" article, i don't want to feel like im behind and transform this into a source of internal guilt and shame. logically this is a meaningless gesture that just delays the project another day, but contextualizing it in my mind this way will really help me. at least i hope. writing these updates also helps a lot in the sense that i can recognize patterns / pitfalls more easily, and seeing them in front of me so clearly makes it easier to deal with them. but aside from all THAT, i worked on drawabox today! superimposed lines are finished :3 tomorrow i wanna actually draw THREE pages instead of just one. crazy, right?!? i could probably also work on walk the line a bit, i don't wanna leave it sittin' for too long.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 13TH</b><br>
			i had an unexpectedly busy day today, so i didn't even start on the game proper ;-; i DID do a lot of thinking and work on the design doc though. anyways im tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiired bye
		</p>

			<b>JANUARY 12TH</b><br>
			<video src="jan12.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
			i made bridget jumper today. yahoo!! really not that amazing as you can tell but its a cute little project. i'm quite happy. next up: i've gotta get rollin on the pirate software game jam!!! it actually started TODAY, not tomorrow, i didn't realize! it's two weeks though so i've got some time. wish me luck :)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 11TH</b><br>
			had a very fun day today but i was honestly exhausted by the time i got home, so i didn't end up working on the bridget jumper again. i know i can still finish it (can honestly be made in a couple hours), so that'll wait for tomorrow. i wasn't planning to get too much done today due to fun times, so it's to be expected.<br>
			still, i did manage to do a sketch page today! paradoxically it looks bad, but i like looking at it. i drawabox is definitely a side project but i wanna up the anti on it a <i>little</i> bit, especially on days like today where my brain is really not in a problem solving sort of mood.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 10TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on bridget jumper at ALL today... and my deadline is friday!!!!!!! ahhhhhh
			i shouldn't be procrastinating this much but i still think i can do it, it's a VERY simple meme game lol. still, i did work on the website a little today updating the links page and stuff, but i gotta get on it.
			to accomplish this, im gonna try a new challenge: no twitter, youtube, or reddit until the weekend. wish me luck!
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 9TH</b><br>
			shoulda done a little more workin and a little less youtube, but it's okay. worked more on bridget jumper... got hung up for a really long time on window scaling, which is all i ended up doing today :/ i remember it took my a while learning the first time, too, so i shouldn't be too harsh on myself. actually now that im looking at the time i did do an okay 1.5 hours so i guess that's not the worst, but i know i can to better!!!! >:)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 8TH</b><br>
			i didn't realize until now, but there had been an issue with uploading the changes to git so this hasn't been uploaded for a few days. whoops!!! also... i was a day behind?!?!?! guess i skipped a day..? i can't believe it, i <i>swear</i> i wrote one every day but i can't seem to find anything missing in past commits..... i think what happened is that i accidentally wrote one in the wrong spot (not at the top), and in moving it i accidentally deleted one of the logs. maybe. regardless, i'll be more careful in the future >.<<br>
			<b>EDIT:</b> okay the problem was actually just the date on my computer was set one day forward (it messed up from when i booted into linux hehe...). as for what i ACTUALLY did today, i worked on the website for a good few hours! i fixed the chatbox (cbox -> chatango) and expanded the backrooms. yahoo!<br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 7TH</b><br>
			i felt unassually sad today, although i cheered up after going to a friends house c: as is propetually the case, i didn't get quite as much done as i was hoping... whatever!!!!! today i figured out how to "fix" environment variables with an autoexec script for powershell. the documentation is kinda terrible (no mention that i have to set a PATH and the actual variable!?!?!??!), but whatever... i managed, and i also got raylib compiling on windows again! yahoo! i've got a pretty funny (and easy) game idea hehe<br>
			but what took up most of my time today was just reorganizing my files (finally banished onedrive), and re-setting up some old applications i used to have on my old computer (im just gonna use notepad++ for a text editor, using vim on windows is a miserable experience i give up)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 6TH</b><br>
			okay somethings gotta change. i said i was gonna work on something eles today, but im STILL in the linux mines trying to get things to work. both becasue of how much of a pain it's been and becasue im really not doing as much as i should be. im just gonna bite the bullet and work on windows for at LEAST the rest of this month - i've got an idea to fix environment variables: an autoexec powershell script!! should probably work...<br>
			(i technically did do a LITTLE bit of drawabox, but it was just rewatching the 50% rule because i forgot the guidelines. doens't really count).<br>
			also, i need to stop playin' guilty gear for a bit. i feel like im slowly becoming more hot-headed over time because im like "im playing a lot, i should be good!!!" kind of like im trying to compensate or something, and its making the game less fun and distracting me from my stuffffffffff. gr. also pirate software gamejam is next week oh god. i am not ready...<br>
			plan for tomorrow: make bridget jumper. or else.<br>
			(also also i REALLY need to fix my sleep schedule its 1:39 rn aaaaaaaa)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 5th</b><br>
			all i worked on today was trying to set up linux mint, and MAN has it been a pain!! booting was pretty easy, but it's stuck in a super low 4:3 resolution and i can't change it ("unknown display"). gahhh! i guess this technically counts as working on a project cus its my "dev environment," but i think tomorrow i should take a break, maybe do some work on this website and walk the line.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 4TH</b><br>
			you know my sleep schedule is bad when it's the next day already by that time im writing this lol. didn't get as much done today as i would have liked, i kinda procrastinated until an hour before midnight (played don't starve for the first time)... but anyways, today i restarted on the drawabox lessons! i tried the course like 6 months ago but only did 5 or so pages. im choosing to start over since i did so little it didn't really stick.. it shouldn't take too long to make up, anyways. i did a page of super imposed lines! also, i didn't buy that usb flash drive but i found an old 32gb SD card, so i could probably just boot linux from that. it'll have to wait til tomorrow though.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 3RD</b><br>
			<img src="jan3.png"><br>
			i made a lil' game today! the setup was super jank (for some reaosn linux mint wasn't working for awhile (i think i gave the VM too much memory??) AND build-essential still couldn't install. i think the iso i got has a different repository or something.. anyways, i went back to pop os since it's giving me less problems so far (although i prefer the windows style UI of mint. idk). i actually figured out how to build raylib - i was doing everything right except my makefile. i still don't know how to use make for this, but i realized using the "simplest possible build script" from the raylib wiki was pretty easy (just a 1 line bash file), so i did that and it worked!!! then i spent like 20 minutes making a veeeery simple clicker game.<br>
			holy crap i forgot how """strings""" and pointers work... but it was still pretty easy thanks to TextFormat(). still, i gotta relearn pointers.<br>
			tomorrow i wanna: 1) investigate a 3rd distro. i like the UI of mint but it's givin' me problems so idk (maybe im just an idiot) 2) get a good USB flash drive to boot from and that also has decent capacity (like 128gb or something). 3) start making a jumper game (like the chrome dinosaur game)

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 2ND</b><br>
			only worked about ~30 minutes today. i spent some more time looking into linux figuring out if i should duelboot on a single drive (i came to the conclusion that it's probably fine with a modern UEFI instead of a BIOS, should prevent windows update from messing up the partitions), but i need a usb drive to boot from. the one i have is only 16gb which isn't enough for linux mint :( (and it's really slow. probably like over 15 years old lol).<br>
			as for the work i actually did get done... well i started over since (this time with linux mint) im pretty sure i was doing everything wrong, and... can't fetch build-essential from the server!! im not sure what to do about that, but it didn't happen yesterday so i assume its cus the package servers are down? i could install git and neovim just fine though.. idk i'll try in a bit tomorrow. but yeah, trying to boot linux mint and troubleshooting that was literally all i did today. oh well<br>
			also, skiing kinda sucked >.<
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 1ST</b><br>
			didn't get as much done as i was hoping. there was sort of a shift in plans - i finally cracked and decided to start trying out linux after i tried AGAIN to get environment variables in windows 11 to work for like 1.5 hours, to no avail (seriously i have probably wasted like 5 hours total on this). so for the last hour-ish, i ran pop os in virtualbox and did all my work in there. i accidentally set it to scale mode and couldn't figure out how to unset it, so it was really strecthed lol. i downloaded and compiled raylib, but i couldn't figure out how to compile my c code, it kept saying all the raylib functions were missing so there must have been some issue with linking. i have no idea how c works lol. despite this, im still feeling alright... i'll probably keep working in a VM til' i finish this little game. i should probably duelboot linux and windows, using windows for gaming and linux for everything else, but that'll have to wait.<br>
			going skiing tommorrow (the snow season SUCKS this year, nothing til JANUARY!??!?!), so im not sure how much i'll get done... i'll do at least a little bit though!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>DECEMBER 31, 2023</b><br>
			the new year technically hasn't started yet, but i wanna start the tradition. today i mainly worked on this website for ~2-3 hours i think, mainly focused on adding the new blog that i wrote yesterday along with the new machinations page (and updating the thing of the month, of course). tomorrow i'm going to try to get a super simple c dev environment setup with raylib + make, and make a super simple game, like a clicker or something. i also need to fix my vim config, syntax highlighting won't work for some reason .-.<br>
			wish me luck for the new year!
