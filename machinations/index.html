		<p class="entry" style="text-align:center;">for context, read <a href="../writing/4/index.html">this</a>.<br>
		tldr: i've kinda been stuck in a rut, and this log catalogues my attempts to dig myself out. my goal is to work on my projects (wheither it be games, videos, art, or something else entirely) for atleast 30 minutes every day.</p>

		<!-- REMEMBER UR MEDS DUMMY!!! >:( -->

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 22</b><br>
			there's still a lot to do, but i worked hard today. i sort of stupidly forgot i was supposed to be working on walk the line today and just kept cranking out the video for like 4 hours hehe... so that wasn't the best, but work is work so im happy. i <i>definitely</i> didn't get to everything i wanted to get done today, but i did really try. that's all i can ask of myself. i hope to keep it up tomorrow :)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 21</b><br>
			i did some good stuff today (more work on the video, about 33% done?) but i procrastinated wayy too much on some other stuff and i have been staying up way too late, including today. gotta do better next week. anyways, the plan:<br>
			- monday: walk the line<br>
			- tuesday: walk the line + drawabox<br>
			- wednesday: walk the line<br>
			- thursday: walk the line + sketching<br>
			- friday: website; backrooms, update music, add portal to nekoweb<br>
			- saturday: video<br>
			- sunday: video<br>
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 20</b><br>
			i did a TON of work today on the video, but its still far from done. i also ended up staying up later than i should have because i was so absorbed, ahhh!!! im happy that im actually, like, WORKING though :) had a lot of fun aswell, so overall was a great day
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 19</b><br>
			i feel better today!! guess it wasn't that bad, huh? didn't get any work on the site down though, that's okay. i had a lot to do today so i don't blame myself. tomorrow, i think i'll start on the lordknight masters video (hopefully i can finish it in 2 days?)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 18</b><br>
			i kinda just rotted in bed and procrastinated for most of the day ;-; literally all i did was play spelunky and clash royale. but im feeling a bit better now, played tf2 and gartic phone with some friends and it cheered me up. procrastinated waaaaaaaaay too much today though. i just need to survive tomorrow, ima try to work in the site a bit but im gonna take it easy.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 17</b><br>
			i still feel like crap today, definitely sick. im hoping to just rest up tomorrow.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 16</b><br>
			today was even worse than yesterday. my alergies are absolutely killing me and i can barely get anything done. very stressed. im gonna take wednesday and thursday off because to be frank i feel like i can barely function as is
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 15</b><br>
			horrible day today, although i did manage to read through a lot of the intructional material on drawing boxes. but i didn't actually get to the assignment, or walk the line for that matter, it was a lot to take in and there was a personal problem nagging at me so it was hard to focus. i just wanna sleep
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 14</b><br>
			i actually wrote a little today. yippee!! it's very little admitedly (~200 words + rewrote a few paragraphs) but im happy i got out of my rut and did SOMETHING. idk, i felt like i sorta overcame a bit of a mental block i guess? at least partically. anyways, i wanna try to write <i>every day</i> next week, even if it's literally just opening up the document and writing like 3 sentences. i wanna build up the habit of thinking about my own story and wanting to work on it, so i can get excited about it again rather than building it up in my head to some impossible burden that i just don't want to think about. ALSO! i wanna start workiing on drawabox more because i've kind of neglected it this month. trying to focus on the story is good, but i think working on other stuff is a necessary pace breaker and ive actually been making pretty decent progress on my drawing ability in my opinion so i wanna continue that. also also, i wanna start work on the 'thing of the month' for april (the april 1st vid doesn't count, that's really for march). im thinking a highlight video for the lord knight masters invitational, but its not 100% locked in so i might change my mind. thats just what im gonna write on my plan for now. speaking of:<br>
			- monday: drawabox + walk the line<br>
			- tuesday: focused on walk the line<br>
			- wednesday: sketching + walk the line<br>
			- thursday: focused on walk the line<br>
			- friday: fav <s>comics</s> manga page + walk the line<br>
			- saturday: start lord knight masters highlight video<br>
			- sunday: walk the line focus<br>
			wish me luck :P
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 13</b><br>
			i ended up being more busy than i expected today so i didn't actually end up working on walk the line, just the website. this is becoming a problem. so, from here forward im gonna try harder to ONLY work on the website if its friday, even if i didn't get much done on friday! realistically the website should be very low on my priorities so i wanna work on other stuff...... erg!! i really dont wanna work on walk the line tbh but i just gotta push through and do it. i'll try again tomorrow!!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 12</b><br>
			did a LITTLE bit of work on the website today. i kinda forgot yesterday that friday is website day, so i think its fine i didn't write anything. tomorrow, though, i gotta stop saying "tomorrow" and do it NOW!!! i honestly think if i just sat down and really tried i could write a chapter in 1 day. maybe. i want to try that at least, see how much i could write if i did it like all day. um... that sounds kinda weird... but you know what i mean.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 11</b><br>
			i did have a bit of time today but agh. i was really tired, so i was feeling especially lazy. excuses excuses i know... grr. i need to just kinda push through and write at least a BIT even though im tired. just 30 mins. but eh. ill try tomorrow. i need sleep
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 10</b><br>
			i ate too much and now i have a stomach ache. hopefully it'll go away by tomorrow morning.. >.< also im realizing i thought it was thursday yesterday when i was writing but whatever!! i <i>think</i> i might actually have a bit of time tomorrow so i'll try to write a little. little bit behind on sleep again, time to zzzzzzzz
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 9</b><br>
			im going to bed early today in attempt to repair my sleep schedule. i feel asleep when i got home cus i was so tired... but yeah, still nothing today. i've been kinda overloaded. i think i'll take tomorrow off also, but FRIDAY should be good. in fact, i'll try to make a schedule for the days i can work:<br>
			- friday: work on favorite media page!!! fav shows + comics<br>
			- saturday: try to actually write.<br>
			- sunday: moar
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 8</b><br>
			ummmmmmmmmmm so my laziness has caught up with me. it's midnight but there's a ton more i need to do still... agh!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate ruining my sleep schedule but i kinda gotta. i'll try to go to bed ~2-3 hours earlier tomorrow to maybe try and fix it but for now i just gotta roll with it. no work on walk the line, i have bigger problems right now.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 7</b><br>
			nothing today. well, almost. i did technically manage to fix something on the new favorite media page (the heart), but it doesn't really count. wasn't a great day for me, i neglected a lot of things that i needed to take care of.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 6</b><br>
			i spent so much time working on the favorite media page that i ended up neglecting to work on walk the line, ahh!!! i did, by coincidene, end up thinking of some good (i think) ideas though for the story, so i guess that's kinda an accidental win. regardless, i wanna try to actually write tomorrow. letting the masses know about my inferior taste in media can wait!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 5</b><br>
			dgjhsjdhgsdjg the website thingy stuff i was trying to do is really hard for some reason!!!!! grr.. its okay though. im just gonna leave the favorite media page in its half baked state for tonight... maybe tomorrow i'll try to work on it more? idk. was a pretty good day today though
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 4</b><br>
			today was a really good day. i did spend quite a bit of time not working, but it was doing good stuff (playing cute indie games) instead of scrolling on youtube or something dumb, so i actually got soemthing good out of it. and that's not to say i didn't do work either, i was fairly productive i think!! i did some drawing, and like, it wasn't <i>good</i> but it's good for me. i'm feelin' good about it, i think i am actually improving... but i need to do moar! (it is never enough) looking forward to it though. i did end up staying up like 30 mins past midnight which isn't ideal... ack! sleep schedules are hard.... i'll try to fix it tomorrow. but yeah. this is the best day i think in a really long time. im happy :)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 3</b><br>
			didn't do anything today, but im trying to keep my sleep schedule intact so im not gonna stay up or anything. i did have a moderate amount of work to do + i feel asleep for like 3 hours, but i definitely could have fit in some drawing. tomorrow i wanna try to procrastinate less so this doesn't happen again.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 2</b><br>
			ok. okokokokokokokok... it's not time for slopping! it's time for... um... planning!! a little late, sure, but better late than never!<br>
			- today: drawabox... idk whatevers next, i forget.<br>
			- wednesday: walk the line<br>
			- thursday: drawing<br>
			- friday: website; overhawl fav media page. make the page itself a little more unique looking, and also make the pages for games and shows<br>
			- saturday: walk the line<br>
			- sunday: walk the line<br>
			...i also wanted to write a bit about how i'm doing now, a quarter of the way into the year. i think i just want to sort of take things a little easier, in a sense. i want to state upfront that i <i>really</i> don't want to give the impression that i am going insane / deserve abuncha sympathy or whatever. don't get my wrong, i am often pretty dissapointed / frusterated, but realistically i have a pretty good life. i'm stressed sometimes, but it's <i>me</i> bringing it on myself. when i first started writing these logs i said that i needed pressure, and i still stand by that. but i feel i'm not really putting pressure on myself so much as just tormenting myself. i'm glad that i've found something i really, really care about, but there's comes a point where its just too much. having all of these goals and estimates and things is its not necessarily bad, but it really hurts me when i don't live up to them, and i almost never do. this isn't just a thing in the last 2 years -- it's <i>always</i> been like this. even when i was making teralite, that game took literally 8-10x longer than i was expecting, and at the time i felt pretty bad about it even though i look at that era now with envy. infact, the things i've been most successful with this past week, drawabox, the website, and small coding projects were the things i <i>didn't</i> have long term deadlines for. i think that speaks volumes. going forward, i want to try to be more fair with myself. on a day to day scale, i want to try to focus more on <i>effort</i> rather than just what i did or didn't get done. for larger goals, i want to be much more realistic and adjust them when it's clear things aren't going the way i thought they would. i also wanna stick to shorter deadlines, i.e. individual chapters instead of an entire story. speaking of... i'm going to try and wrap up chapter 1 of walk the line by the end of this week. not a hard deadline, but i want to <i>try</i>.<br>
			~~<br>
			writing this part later!!! i did drawabox today... funnels! was kinda hard, the i feel like a got a bit worse at drawing elipses over the break but ahdhasd. its okay. um.. another thing i wanted to talk about.. i still wanna do a project this month, but i am going to hold off until next week. still want to do it earlier rather than.. like, the last day this time though. might be a game design article, but i was thinking it might be good to take a break from writing so ehhhhhhhh idk. i think there was something else i wanted to add but i forgot (about it in 2 seconds). so, uhhh, byebye
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>APRIL 1</b><br>
			honestly, i've just been triyng not to think about this for the past... almost week. i felt like i needed to sort of vent, so i made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x9XYZqyReU">this abomination</a>. glad i got something done today. i'll make a plan for the week and how to maybe bounce back tomorrow, i think.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 26</b><br>
			i had another fun day, but i didn't do anything. really didn't feel like it. in fact, i haven't even made a plan for this week... gosh. im gonna take tomorrow off. i think i want just a a guilt-free break so i can take some time to kinda think things over. im really dissapointed i've been working on this story for 6 months and i've barely made any progress. idk. just wanna slow things down for a bit.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 25</b><br>
			had a lot happen today. it was alotta fun, but i'm really feeling pretty... awful right now, to be honest. i don't think i have it in me today. i will try to get back into the swing of things tomorrow.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 24</b><br>
			barely got anything done today, but i had very little time because i was hanging out with friends all day. unproductive, but worth it!!! tomorrow i'm going skiing again.. probably won't be the best day either, but i'll try.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 23</b><br>
			i did work today, but didn't follow through with my plan at all. i wanted to sorta do some more work on the website because i didn't get much done yesterday.... but then i never actually got to walk the line, AND i didn't even remotely finish the favorite media page! it's ok though... i just don't wanna repeat this tomorrow.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 22</b><br>
			pretty unproductive like last friday, but i did do some backrooms expansion and JUST started making the favorite media page.. i'll do more later!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 21</b><br>
			felt good about today! did some drawing -- with reference, this time. i was really worried about using reference for awhile because drawabox cautioned against using it to avoid drawing something poorly, which felt EXACTLY like what i was reaching to it for. but after going without reference for a bit, i think i can safely say that's not the problem anymore. i just really struggle with drawing a lot of things - especially like body proportions and faces and stuff. so having reference is good. however, im still being careful to 1) try to draw things without reference first and 2) not copy a reference image exactly. maintaining my sleep schedule still, too. yahoo! anyways, tomorrow im probably gonna be more chilled out watching arcrevo and stuff... but i'll try to be more productive than i was last friday. im way behind on walk the line at this point but i don't wanna "punish" myself for it so im just gonna maintain my schedule for the remainder of the week.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 20</b><br>
			sufficive to say, i did NOT finish chapter 1 today. i did work a bit though. still writing very slowly, but i think it might be getting a <i>bit</i> better, just a bit. still though, i am definitely behind. i also wasted a LOT of time today, i basically just had so much free time that i still had some left over to work on the story. not ideal, i'll try to work on it. one thing that is going well is my sleep schedule... i actually did feel quite a bit better and more rested today. it's 5 mins before midnight right now and i wanna keep it up, so goodnight!!!!!! looking forward to taking a break from the story tomorrow.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 19</b><br>
			well, its 1:00... today was a weird day. i felt more drousy despite the fact i slept more, although maybe it was just because the lack of sleep from the previous day finally caught up with me. regardless, by the evening i was so tired i feel asleep reading a book and woke up 2 hours later. so, technically im not behind on sleep going to bed 1 hour late but it's really not the best to have my sleep segmented like this. ill try to fix it tomorrow. one good thing about last night though: i actually had a dream for the first time in forever. wowiee! HOWEVER, i didn't ever get to working on walk the line today. this was a time management problem - the nap was kinda enivitable, but i wasted like 1:30 before that playing guilty gear. shoulda used atleast 30 minutes of that to work on the story. i could work on it right now but again, im trying to prioritize sleep more. i'll try to be more careful going forward.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 18</b><br>
			alrighty. first and foremost, i think it's become clear that i need to make sleep more of a priority. so from here forward, im gonna really try to go to bed by midnight, no matter what -- even if it means i don't do anything that day! the i think my lack of sleep is sorta getting to the point where it's putting too much strain on me, and it might be why i feel so slow in the head. it's just not worth it. today, i didn't really have a plan so i kinda just did some updating to the site, like the music page and whatnot... really not what needed to be done, but that's a consequence of staying up so late yesterday that i couldn't make my plan for the week!!! see what im sayin?? anyways, im gonna make that plan now:<br>
			TUESDAY - walk the line. won't have much time, but a start on the final scene of chapter 1 would be good.<br>
			WEDNESDAY - really try to finish chapter 1, even if its rough and crappy.<br>
			THURSDAY - sketch page; start using reference! (i'll explain this more the day of)<br>
			FRIDAY - site work; backrooms expansion + favorite media page. try to be a liiitle more focused, but still keepin it as an easyish day<br>
			SATURDAY - start on chapter 2. should be the easiest chapter since much of it is already written<br>
			SUNDAY - finish chapter 2 with the cafe scene. i know you have no idea what that is, but i do!!!!!<br>
			there's more i could write, but it's time to zzzzzzzzzzzzz
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 17</b><br>
			there's alotta things i need to write about, such as the plan for next week, but its way too late. i need to sleep
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 16</b><br>
			i procrastinated on walk the line until rediculously late at night, but i did work on it for a good 2 hours. it's almost 3 though so i really need to go to bed...
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 15</b><br>
			not a super productive day today but that's okay :) just did some backrooms expansion while chillin on a gokanaru stream
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 14</b><br>
			ummm... well im not too good at this, am i? i don't know. i just felt like crap this week i guess. could barely fufill like the bare minimum of stuff i needed to do, so working on walk the line on top of that just sounded like a lot... to be clear, i have TIME, it's a time management problem. i just need to get better at doing things i don't wanna do (in the moment). i don't wanna dwell on it too much because i don't think there's a whole lot to be learned honestly. i just need to be more commited. also, i notice that once the ball of negativity gets rollin (i skip a day), it becomes very easy to justify skipping again. this journal helps keep that in check a little cus i don't wanna look bad, but i still wanna be more aware of that. from now on, i wanna WRITE in this everyday even if i didn't actually do anything. i think just having that conversation with myself will help prevent that sort of doom spiral in the future. um, as for today... im obviously very behind, so im not sure chapter 2 is happening this week, but i actually did pretty good today! worked on walk the line for a good 2ish hours i wanna say, and did two pages of the ellipses in planes excercise. feelin' good! i still want to stick sort of to the plan, so tomorrow im gonna work on this site for a bit while i watch videos and stuff (friday is the only day i'll allow myself to watch youtube)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 10</b><br>
			another very unproductive day. was fun (hung out with friends), but unproductive nevertheless. all i did was update nongmotrash.nekoweb.org and added like 1 page to the backrooms. i wanted to "touch up the homepage" a bit but idk. don't really have it in me today. also, i failed to write the first chapter of walk the line this week, so next week im kinda gonna be doin' catchup. i gotta think about what i'm going to put out this month, but given im already behind, this week just isn't it. im gonna try to allocate more time to walk the line this week in order to catch back up.<br>
			- monday: walk the line chapter 1: scenes 2 & 3<br>
			- tuesday: walk the line chapter 1: start writing scene 4<br>
			- wednesday: walk the line chapter 1: finish scene 4 (first chapter complete!)<br>
			- thursday: drawabox exercise (idk whatever the next one is)<br>
			- friday: new backroom, update links, restyle side parts & webrings of homepage<br>
			- saturday: walk the line chapter 2: rewrite polish existing scenes from 1st draft<br>
			- sunday: walk the line chapter 2: write cafe scene (second chapter complete!)<br>
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 9</b><br>
			i'm not gonna pretend to have written anything close to enough, but i did write. kinda procrastinated on it fofr almost the entire day, but once i started it wasn't that bad. my plan is to speedrun the website work tomorrow and finish chapter 1... maybe. atleast the first three scenes.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 8</b><br>
			wasn't terriblely productive but it's a friday so it okay :) did some sketchin late at night
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 7</b><br>
			i finished the first scene of chapter 1 today! however, i've outlined <i>4</i> scenes for that chapter, so i definitely got some work to do. i'm gonna hope for the best on saturday (should have plenty of time provided i can stay focused), but i'm gonna stick to the plan and do a sketch page tomorrow. perhaps i'll work on the story a liiiiitle bit if i have time.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>MARCH 6</b><br>
			im very slowly trying to fix my sleep schedule, it's 15 past midnight right now which is really not great but my work took way longer than expected today so it's not unreasonable. still gotta work on it though, i wanna start sleeping at least 1-1.5 hours earlier. i worked on walk the line today but unfortunately i was unable to fully nail down the chapter 4 outline... endings are hard. however, i do have a much better (if a bit vague) idea of what's going to happen, so i have a destination to move towards. i've decided that for the rest of the week i'm just going to focus on writing chapter 1 because it's wednesday and i haven't i barely have anything. also, i've been thinking about what i might do for the "thing of the month" in march (walk the line won't work because i will probably do a 3rd draft after march before i release it)... one idea in my head has been "can big brother youtube save my wicked soul?" video... i think it would be really funny. perhaps kinda weak without VO though... not sure. regardless, i'll probably work on that next week because i want to stick to my plan for this week. anywho, cya (i wonder, do people actually read these??)

			i'm writing this on the 6th becasue it was 2 am and i was tired lol. i still kinda stuck in a malaise during the morning and felt awful, but i eventually snapped out of it and actually had a really productive day. i did have a lot on my plate though as i didn't do anything the previous day, so i was busy, pretty much working all day save for a 2 hour nap (and a break for dinner of course). i did another table of elipses for ~1.5 hours in the dead of night. i was reaaaaaaaally tempted to just be like nope - i need sleep, but im really happy that i pushed through and got it done. it wasn't as bad as the last time, and i think i got quite a bit better at the execution, too. still, i don't wanna ignore the fact that yesterday i kinda just died. i kinda had bouts of depression like this last year too (though much more intense), so i don't wanna fall into that trap again. i think the main thing i wanna work on is my sleep schedule.. actually going to be like 1-2 hours BEFORE midnight rather than after would really make a big difference for my focus and i think it would definitely be worth the time spent. i should be able to easily get everything done before then anyways if i just manage my time better. anyways, i gotta get to work for today! got lots to do, and i'm hoping to finish outlining chapter 4 of walk the line like i was planning to do on the 4th. i still wanna try to finish the first chapter by the end of this week. it'll be tough, but i think i can do it if i really try. wish me luck!

			<b>MARCH 3</b><br>
			stayed home today to try and get a lot of work done, but it was only semi successful. i <i>did</i> finally finish the tunes page on the sitw which took foreeeeeeeeeeeeever and im really glad its done, but i was planning to also do a page of elipses :( but its too late now. it was really hard for me to focus because doing the tunes page involves a lot of going to youtube, which means is veeeeery easy to get distracted so i worked a lot slower than i should have been. im happy its finally done though (at least for the time being) as it was soooooooooooooo tedius. anyhow, for next week:<br>
			- monday: walk the line chapter 4 outline<br>
			- tuesday: drawabox, table of elipses<br>
			- wednesday: work on walk the line chapter 1<br>
			- thursday: work on walk the line chapter 1<br>
			- friday: sketch page<br>
			- saturday: finish walk the line chapter 1<br>
			- sunday: fix nekoweb site, expand backrooms, touch up home page a lil<br>
			i stayed up way later than i should have this weekend but today's a bit more reasonable, only 20 mins til midnight (_　_)。゜zｚＺ

			<b>MARCH 2</b><br>
			um... so i KINDA failed again... let me explain. technically, i didn't ever go a day without doing <i>anything</i>, but the last two days have been extremely unproductive and it was definitely less than 30 minutes. the main reason i didn't write anything was because i was working extremely late at night and was super tired (which is my fault, bad time management), and also because i felt like it was disingenious to be like "yeah i worked on walk the line today :)))" when realistically i just opened it for 5-10 minutes and barely wrote anything. so im marking this as... gosh, the THIRD time i broke my resolution!!! i'm pretty dissapointed in myself, but i don't wanna wallow in it. so i'm gonna do the usual thing and try to reflect on it a little... i think my main problem has stemmed from walk the line itself. i've said this before but i find it EXTREMELY difficult to just, like, write. i'm very perfectionist in the sense that i can't just let go from and write a draft that i know is probably crappy just to get something onto the page, it's gotta be the best thing i can possibly write, even if it's literally an OUTLINE, and that makes things extremely hard. looking back and realizing that i've been "working on my second draft" for literal months now has been... disparaging. i feel so stupid. i know it's very common to experience writer's block, but it honestly feels like i'm not even trying even though i know i am. and every day i waste on this, i feel like i'm falling further and further behind on my gamedev, and it's really biting away at me. i've seriously contemplating just putting walk the line on a hiatus for the forseeable future. but i've made up my mind; i want to see this thing through to atleast the 2nd draft. no half measures. i've delayed / canceled WAAAAAY too many projects in the past 2 years, and i gotta break the cycle. i felt this way on teralite too, but i pushed through and i'm soooo glad i did. i gotta have that same mindset here, too. so. i'm working until it's done, no matter how long it takes. however! i would like to have a goal to aim for: march 31. sounds far away but that gives me ~1 week per chapter, which is pretty reasonable in my opinion. in fact, i also wanna have deadlines for each individual chapter: saturday of each week. i hope having smaller, more "bite sized" goals to work towards will keep me on track better for the big ones. um... as for what i actually did TODAY - i didn't do drawabox because i was feeling like crap about the story and wanted to work on it, so i'll probably do that table of elipses tomorrow. i did make some good progress on walk the line though, finally outlining the third chapter and touching up the first two!! i'm happy, it was very hard to write for some reason but i feel like i'm finally hitting my stride. tomorrow though, i'm taking a break to do that drawabox and to work on the website some.

			worked on walk the line for an hour or so. still tough, but i think the ideas are flowing a bit more now.. sorry im being brief, just tired.

			<b>FEBURARY 26</b><br>
			today was not a good day. i... well i did <i>try</i> to write, but again, not much done. it was a bit more than previous days but realistically its still basically nothing. idk. i can't tell if im just lazy or stupid or what.. i don't know what to do. i've gotten back into the habit of bypassing the blocker... this entire day i was kind of just trying to forget about my responsibilities, if i'm being honest. im very dissapointed in myself. i honestly feel like im just going through the motions to just have SOMETHING to write here at the end of the day, which i guess is a start, but man... agh!! idk why i can't just write this stupid thing. although it's not just that, doing any work has felt way harder this past week or so. like even doing that page of elipses 2 days ago, which was only 2 hours of work, took SO much mental energy i felt kinda tired afterward. idk why i can't do anything, it really does feel like im cursed. i don't know what to do. tomorrow, though, i'll have a break from writing so i hope maybe i can refresh my mind or something... crap. im really dreading tomorrow, i neglected so much stuff today.. i need to go to sleep, it's way too late.

			this was another one of those days where i was like "i had alotta fun :) but i didn't get much done!! D:" ... all i did was start my nekoweb outpost... um... you can see it <a href="https://nongmotrash.nekoweb.org/">here</a>... made it in like 40 mins lol. but yeah, didn't really work on this site as much as i wanted, was supposed to finish the tunes page today... but it can wait. exposing my weird music taste to the world isn't really high priorty. you know what is though!?!??! the GRAND PLAN for next week!!<br>
			- monday: finish outlining chapter 3 (or else). this has beenn reaaaaaaaaally hard for some reason, half laziness and half writer's block, and i really considered just giving up or something but.. no!! i gotta push through!!!<br>
			- tuesday: 1 page of sketching<br>
			- wednesday: outline chapter 4 (final)<br>
			- friday: start writing chapter 1, up to the first scene<br>
			- saturday: another table of elipses for drawabox (agh!!! really hard for some reason hehe..)<br>
			- sunday: finish tunes page + outpost expansion... maybe link on the main site

			did a table of elipses for draw a box today - its so much harder than it looks lol. took like 2 hours ;-; i didn't do anything for walk the line, idk just writers block i guess... regardless, im just going to stick to the original plan for tomorrow.

			<b>FEBURARY 23</b><br>
			heya. today was pretty dissapointing; and reading back at the past week or so, it hasn't been the only one. i've begun to exploit the overide on leechblock and i've spent waaaaaaay more time than i should have on youtube today. i did some work on drawabox and the teralite patch but it was definitley kinda a struggle today. to counteract this, i've decided to change how i allocate the social media time: instead of 30 minutes every day (or 90 minutes if it's a weekend), i'm switching to 0 time on everyday but it's completely unblocked friday, serving as my "movie night" sorta. i think this method will be a lot better for two reasons. first, it allows me to watch long form content without cheating the timer, which is what i did today (and previous days, to a lesser extent) and has resulted in me spending too much time on youtube. the second reason is because i feel spending any time on youtube makes me want mooooar and makes me more likely to circumvent the timer that day, so having a clear divide between "it's allowed" or "it isn't" will work better for me, i think. i also want to better manage how i allocate my time to my various projects. with everything i got goin' on, i feel my focus is becoming increasing fractured which is making it harder to actually complete anything. to curve this, i'm going to put the teralite patch on hold because i think having 4 simultaneous projects is just too much. from now on i want to keep it as 1 main project + 2 permanent-ish backburner things. so from now on, i wanna kinda plan out what im going to do each day of the week every sunday. i didn't do this last sunday obviously, so i'm just going to do it now for the remaining two days of the week. both days, i'll have irl stuff i need to do but i should still have plenty of time to work on my projects.<br>
			- satuday: finish the walk the line outline (seriously im just gonna sit there with it open until its done), do a page of a table of elipses for draw a box<br>
			- sunday: finish the tunes page of the website once and for all (it's been really tedius adding all the tracks lol), and add a room or two to the backrooms<br>

			skiing was fun :) didn't get much done today though, although i wasn't planning on much. just drawing. tomorrow: MOAR!!!

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 21</b><br>
			wasn't a great day, but better. i spend much of the day sleeping since i slept awful last night, aswell as playing undertale yellow which i wouldn't exactly call time "wasted" but it definitely wasn't productive. i did do some good work on the teralite patch though, got the game at least RUNNING (although it crashes once you get to the title screen..). tomorrow im going skiing, so i don't wanna put too much pressure on myself. maybe just some drawing or something?
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 20</b><br>
			ok i desperately need to add reddit to the block list (i now have). wasted like... idk a lot of time. in fact, i wasted so much time that i'm writing this the day after the fact (again!!!!!!) because i procrastinated until like 2 in the morning. did a tincy tiny bit of work on walk the line but i really am kinda at a block. i think i'll work on the teralite patch more today instead, give it a bit of a rest?
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBRUARY 19</b><br>
			didn't do everything i wanted to today, but it wasn't a complete failure either. just kinda scattered. i did a bit more work on the teralite patch - idk why people are having problems building it, it works for me ;-;-;-; but im gonna port it to godot 4. i think it'll only take a few days; i'll just crack it open now and then when i feel like it. i really WANTED to work on walk the line, but idk. just wasn't my day for writing.. also i starting playing undertale yellow today ^(^.^)^

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 18</b><br>
			i was absolutely exhausted again today... just worked on a site a bit, which is not the greatest. however, i did greatly reduce my social media usage this week so hopefully i can keep it up!! after this weekend, i decided it would be a good idea to set a timer to saturday sunday aswell, i made it 90 minutes instead of the 30 for week days which i think is reasonable. tomorrow i'll be free though (finally!!), so i wanna make that teralite patch and do some drawing, and also get outline another chapter of walk the line. not sure if i'll make the feb 23 deadline but i'll try to atleast fully write another chapter by then.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">

			<b>FEBURARY 16</b><br>
			i'm writing this the day after again aggggghhh!! however, i have a very good excuse: i was sleepy. seriously tho i was downloading something big and i was like "ahh okay im just gonna lay down for a minute while that happens.." and then i woke up at 2:20 in the morning lolol. i love hanging out with friends but my social bandwidth is kinda low so it takes a lot out of me. i did get a little bit of stuff done; mainly, i realized that you can edit videos within youtube to make cuts, which i used to remove a bunch of blank video that i accidentally added to the end of the guilty gear and the calcuator vidoes... really nice that i can do that without reuploading!! i also am considering doing another SMALL patch for teralite. i really don't wanna focus more on making NEW stuff but i do think it could benefit from just a sliiiiiiiiiiight bit of polish, and more importantly, better "documentation" if you wanna call it that. i've had many people tell me they downloaded it on github and can't export it... works on my machineTM!!! seriously though, i wanna try to fix this.

			<b>FEBURARY 15</b><br>
			today was a good day! i did some drawing while streaming it to some friends :3 was pretty fun. i did spend too much time playing clash royale i think (i am addicted to playing all goblins) but i set the timer from 45 minutes -> 25, which i think should help curve it. leechblock is also working pretty well i think... i can't just autopilot during my free time anymore!! also also, i worked on walk the line a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitle bit, i coulda done better but overall im feeling pretty happy with today :)

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 14</b><br>
			again, i'm a bit dissapointed with what i got done today, although i don't wanna be too harsh because i am getting better. i did, however spend a lot of time playing guilty gear which i kind of regret (just not a great day for it, i needed to get rolling today) and i also spent too much time fiddling with leechblock, because it wasn't working how i intended... but i fixed it (it was just me being an idiot). basically i have it configured to only allow me 30 minutes on youtube / twitter per day. i definitely still felt the pull today, like agggggh what do i do now that content machine is gone??? but i think if i keep this up i can hopefully break my addiction. originally i was going to have everything be unrestricted for weekends, but honestly i might limit it to 90 minutes or something. as for what i actually got done: worked more on the walk the line outline. still only 2/4 chapters OUTLINED, and i still need to write all of them... :( however, i should have some more time to write soon (i understand the problem is mainly that i need to MAKE more time for it, but still) so im hoping i can still get the 2nd draft done and ready for beta readers by my feburary 23 goal. tomorrow i wanna outline chapter 3 and maybe also do some drawing :3
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 13</b><br>
			pretty bad day if i'm being honest. i was feeling extremely tired cus i haven't been getting enough sleep, which i sort of used as an excuse to procrastinate all day. i estimate i probably watched at least 4 hours of youtube... i was so desperate i even played clash royale not with friends. i really wanted to get a chapter or 2 of the outline done today, but i barely did anything. my unproductivity today was the tipping point, though, to finally look into a website blocker thingy that doesn't suck. i've tried an extension in the past, can't remember the name rn, but it kinda sucked and the timeframes were straight up bugged as far as i can tell. this one i found now, leechblock, limits my time on youtube and twitter (the biggest culprits) during mon-fri. basically i only get 15 minutes every 2 hours (can stack though, but i think that's okay), otherwise they redirect me <a href="../countdown/index.html">here</a>

			<b>FEBURARY 12</b><br>
			did another page of ghosted plains, and i actually improved quite a bit compared to the first time.. but i had a lot of work to do today, so i didn't have time for much else. im sleepy, it's 1:20
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>FEBURARY 11</b><br>
			i kind of failed again... i don't really have as much to say as last time, i'm just really not the best at this.... but for the 19239th time, i don't wanna strike a balance between apathy and self loathing, so i'm trying to keep my head in it. speaking "positively," i did keep technically keep my streak for 22 days instead of just 15, and i also recovered out of the slump much faster (5 days -> 2)... so i guess i am slowly improving, even if it doesn't feel like it. also i <i>did</i> do some good stuff, such as actually being proactive about finishing my project for feburary early instead of rushing out something at the last minute. so that's good. but you know what's also good? not failing!!!!! so what could i have done better? well last time i sort of talked about how i procrastinated too much, putting off irl work until it was too late which then impacted my ability to work on my own projects. and i will say i think i've gotten a BIT better (keyword: bit), but it's still a problem. however, i've come to realize that this problem exists on a micro-day by day scale aswell. when i get home i usually don't do anything productive for HOURS which is really bad. it tends to put me in difficult situations where i'm like "ok i can either work on my game, work on that important stuff i've been putting off, or sleep good tonight" when realisitcally i could have EASILY done all three. idk. i guess when i get home my brain just wants to deactivate and go social media brainrot; not the best habit to have. so ima curve that. but how?? well, basically in these logs i want to hone in more on <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> i actually did the work that i did, and make a greater effort to notice it and try to improve by habits. so instead of just casually dropping "o yeah i did some ghosted lines at 1:30 lol" i wanna be like, "agh im glad i did something today but i really shouldn't have stayed up so late >:(((" y'know what i mean? so: starting with today, i basically did some work on the website, which i know is kinda like bruh that's easy sauce, but it actually was important as the tunes page has been broken for like 2 weeks lol. so i actually fixed it, and got a youtube music player working (took i think 2ish hours?) which i'm really happy with. previously i was gonna stream it from google drive, but as of like 2 weeks ago they changed it somehow so you can't hotlink stuff (i don't really understand the specifics beyond "it no worky"). i think it was actually kind of a blessing in disguise though, as a youtube player is honestly just better. though, there's one caveot: some videos won't play in the embeded player, only when they're actually on the website! kinda annoying, but i guess i can just find alternate uploads for those songs. but that can wait. oh but yeah, i actually did around when i got home from skiing OH YEAH DID I MENTION I WENT SKIING TODAY?? snow as actually.. present! amazing.. but anyways, i didn't procrastinate until super late at night. yahoo! however.. i am pretty behind on my irl stuff. it's definitely better than before but still bad. im working on it.

			<b>FEBURARY 8</b><br>
			i finally started getting back to work on walk the line again today! a week or so ago, i was telling a friend about my struggles with writing, well, anything... and they asked me "do you know roughly how the story is gonna go?" at the time i said yes, but thinking about it more, i realized i really only had a <i>very</i> vague outline in my head, so i decided to start making an outline. i wanted to do it all today, but as is to be expected at this point, it was unexpectedly difficult to write. i did tackle some interesting challenges such as coming up with some more place names and such and sort of planning out the 4 chapters on a VERY basic level, but only chapter 1 is really properly outlined. like all in all i only wrote ~500 words which... agh!! i just think a lot i guess. will try to finish the outline tomorrow!

			<b>FEBURARY 1</b><br>
			i didn't write yesterday AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! (it's feb 2 now) i've got to stop this. it's occured to me that the value of these entries deminishes quite a bit if i write them the day after because i can only really write about what i'm feeling when i'm feeling it. the days i have been skipped are usually becasue im very busy with other irl stuff and don't finish until past midnight, so im like, "hmmmmm do i really want to boot up my computer and write this when i could just sleep and do it tomorrow?" <i>yes!!</i> yes i do, you dumb dumb! anyways, on to what i actually did yesterday: i did actually work on my projects (although 99% of the day was taken up by a headache + irl stuff), although it was basically just updating the news section of the website along with the thing of the month (not sure it even took 30 minutes?? whatever). again, i don't want to use easy peasy website work as a crutch to pracrastinate on the hard stuff, but i was pretty busy so i guess it's not the worst. on a day like today though (feb 2), i wanna get back to the gamedev journey video!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 31</b><br>
				i didn't write yesterday (again..) cus i was TIRED and didn't want to stay up even later. spent the day mostly doing IRL stuff, and i also recorded and made the <a href="https://youtu.be/kJQkWVQl6Q4?si=HsoFp6jY_ICCn-A5">calculator video</a> in like 30 minutes lol. i wanted to get something more substantial out this month but i but it didn't really go as well as i was hoping due to the reasons i described in the jan 21 entry. still though, i did get into a fairly consistent groove for a bit with doing atleast SOMETHING everyday, albeit not as much as i want. my immediete plan is to put more work into my irl business (i don't want to get stuck in a cycle of getting behind), and i wanna crank out the gamedev video by feb 2-3 hopefully, then get back to walk the line and ACTUALLY WRITE. i've found it very difficult to actually get words on the page, i'm very very afraid of writing something bad even though that's the whole point of a first draft. i need to just let go and write <i>something</i>, then fix it later.<br>
				as for stuff i wanna change: #1) only work on this website (save for these status updates) on the weekends. i think working on this website, while cool, should be a SIDE PROJECT and i've kinda been using it to procrastinate from the other, harder stuff i wanna do, so it's sort of become a crutch with regardes to the "30 mins a day" promise. #2) i wanna not drop a single day next month. january, while dissapointing, was ultimately the first month i really tried to actually push myself to get things done in quite awhile, and i did <i>okay</i> all things considered (my brain rot) but it's ultimately a learning experience. so to prove that i actually have indeed learned, i need to step it up for feburary and get some things done!! specifically: the game dev journey video, walk the line second draft, then i'll try to start on the rage game. also, i've decided that i just want to finish the 2ND DRAFT of walk the line before getting back to game dev -- i think giving it some time to sit without me looking at it will help me comeback with a fresher perspective (+ the feedback!!) and make it better. i also want to get back to games like nOW!! also, i mentioned in an earlier entry that i wanted to do a "state of the trash" post every month, but i think im gonna make that just once a year instead (prob on my birthday). mainly writing about my work EVERY DAY makes a wrapup like that somewhat redundant, and i'm not really active enough to justify doing one every single month. anywho, back to work!!!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 30</b><br>
			so, i spent all of today recording clips for the video -- my gamedev journey so far -- but i've barely even started editing! and considering im gonna cover like 36 games in the video, it's clearly not going to be ready before january is over. not to mention, there's some important irl stuff i've been procrastinating on that i <i>reaaaaaaaally</i> need to do... so plan is: tomorrow, make a quick video (i've got one i can make in like 20 mins lol) and take care of my irl stuff. THEN finish the big gamedev video, THEN get back to walk the line. oh, and i've got to squeeze some drawing in there too.. wish me luck

			i'm actually writing this on the 30th because today i was super tired and really needed to just get some sleep. literally all i did today (in my own time i mean) was archive a bunch of scratch projects -- with the video coming out soon-ish (see tomorrow) i didn't really wanna have it hanging around anymore, mainly because my username is my real name + my area code, lolol. so i'm going to delete my account, but before i did i wanted to archive everything.

			did some more work on walk the line... writing was extremely slow, as always, but it's coming along. a lot of the """work""" happened in my head, and i think i've got a much better idea of where the story is going now.. but i gotta actually, y'know, write. it's hard :( very good experience though. also, the end of january is coming up soon and i want something cool to showcase for this month. i'm thinking i might make a GGST clip dump or something (recording quality from my ps4 is doodoo though). i also want to do a "state of the trash" wrap-up every month that's a bit more formal, summarizing what i did (and didn't!!) do this month and my plans for next month. i'll probably just put those on this page.

			i worked a <i>little</i> on walk the line but not as much as i should have. bad work ethic... but i'm - get this - i'm working on it!!! yeah. overall, pretty uneventful day, but it's a good babystep.

			<b>JANUARY 24</b><br>
			i spent today struggling with getting music playing for the tunes page... i thought it would be an easy little "extra" i could add real quick, but it's ended up being one of the more complicated pages on the site. however, i <i>gotta</i> get working on walk the line again, i haven't touched it in over a month!!! so for the rest of january, i've decided i'm not gonna work on this site at all! just the story and also a bit of drawabox :3 also, i've noticed myself slowly slipping back into the habbit of youtube binging and twitter scrolling.. wasn't too terrible today, but i definitely want to be more disciplined in the future. i'm stupid enough as is - i don't need more distractions.

			<b>JANUARY 23</b><br>
			history repeats: today was another good day, spent time with friends!! but... i didn't start on walk the line like i wnated too >.< spending time with friends is great and i really do cherish it BUT it has kinda ate up my time these past few days, hehe. worth it though. still, i did do the ghosted lines excercise, and i did conjure up some IDEAS for the story. i understand that conjuring is not writing but again, baby steps. i'll work on it.<br>
			ALSO: i forgot to commit the changes to the website yesterday, but i did write them at the time.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 22</b><br>
			today was a super good day!!!!! but... didn't have much time to work on projects. i feel a little stupid for being all "okay time to fix things!!!" yesterday and then being busy, but realistically, today was just too jam packed to really do all that much. still though, i did work on the music catelogue a <i>little</i> bit. tomorrow should be more free though, so i wanna really delve into the story for a few hours and also do the ghosted lines excercise for drawabox.
		</p>

			<b>JANUARY 21</b><br>
			aw man... i kinda.. failed...it's been 5 days!! oops. i do feel pretty bad that i was only able to stick to my resolution for 16 days (technically i have spent ~25% of this year failing), and i don't wanna downplay it too much. not being able to stay focused on what is, realistically, a fairly easy task for even 1 month is.. not the best. no matter what way you slice it, i'm just not the game dev i used to be. but being all "oooo no i faaaaaaaaaailed :(" is not a good way to look at things either. even if my brain really is just <i>that</i> messed up and i just suck at doing anything, and honestly think that's not far from the truth, i still need to be looking for how to improve. so even though i technically """failed""" i'm not gonna give up.<br>
			instead, i'm gonna try to realistically evaluate what went wrong and how i can fix it. firstly, i need to better balance my IRL business and be more proactive with getting it taken care of. specifically, i've often told myself "well im really behind on this thing and that, but i worked on programming today so it's :D" which... is not <i>wrong</i>, but it's not right either. putting off my other work will usually cause it to pile up to a breaking point where i have to crunch and finish a TON of stuff right before a deadline, which ultimately hurts productivity on my personal projects, too. as much as i'd love to just be like "alright, screw this stuff i don't care about, 100% gamedev time >:)," the reality is that's just not in the cards. it might never be. so i just need to learn to balance these things, and maybe try to appreciate the IRL things i get done a little more rather than just being like "ughhhh i coulda been working on the game (or whatever it is) in that time!!!"<br>
			the second problem is, i think, the pirate software game jam. not that there's anything wrong with it, <i>i'm</i> the problem really, but i think i have a lot more growing to do before i can do a game jam longer than like 2 days. i'm trying very very hard to turn things around, but it's undeniable that my subconcious is still in the mindset of "i've already failed, so why even try." a (relatively) long, timed game jam is really bad for me right now because it legitimizes that train of thought in my mind - i really have wasted half of my available time already, so i should just give up so i don't have to think about it. i know this is a problem i need to directly face eventually, but i grow in baby steps. i need to learn to work with some softer, self imposed deadlines first.<br>
			woah... that's a lot! i have a rough plan for how to move forward, but first: i gotta talk about what i did <i>today</i>! it was actually quite a good day (in terms of productivity. but i legit barely left my room so... yeah. not the best), i worked on the website a lot! looking at it you might be like "really? it kinda looks the same :|" but trust me i did a lot! started cleaning up lots of small problems, rewrote some little things, drew some graphics that were previously just generic gifs, and i started on a page with all my favorite music! i still didn't get nearly as much done as i was hoping (i wanted to FINISH the music page AND revamp the scrapbook -> a gallary..), but i put in a lot of effort so i can't really be mad at myself. just how it is, i'll get more productive with practice. i also did some 50% drawing today... currently at a grand total of 4 pages for drawabox!!! wow... that's kinda sucks! but again, baby steps. <i>speaking</i> of baby steps, my plan moving forward: i wanna try to take a bit of a break from game dev and focus on walk the line. having a big unfinished story sitting around has been bothering me, so i wanna clear it off my plate before i get back to games. when i do, i think i'll make a super simple platforming rage game. i want to make something with charm since all my previous games pretty much have beene extremely dry, like 100% focused on the mechanics, which there's nothing wrong with but.. i really wanna make something with heart, you know? but that's a ways off, i suspect finishing the story will be quite the hurdle. but i will have something really good to show for it once it's done!! and of course, i've also wanna work on drawabox and this website periodically. phew! that was a lot of writing. wish me luck :3

			<b>JANUARY 18TH</b><br>
			i skipped yesterday because i was feeling extremely anxious... still wish i would have done something but. whatever.<br>
			today was productive... just not on the game. was busy with irl stuff. i wanna do better, but i don't wanna beat myself up over it. just being conscience of it is a good first step i think. anyways im sleepy
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 16TH</b><br>
			aaaaaaaa i'm not doing to good at this! still didn't start on the game......<br>
			okay i don't wanna doom and gloom though. #1) did work on the website (restored cbox, i'll never betray you again), and #2) i have an idea. i'm gonna NOT use youtube or twitter during the weekdays AT ALL. gonna get that website blocker extension on my computer and setup stuff on my phone (idk app timers!??! idk)... i neeeeeeeeeeeed it. procrastination will kill me. speaking of.. i wanted to do some more drawabox today and i even read the lesson on ghosting lines, but it's reaaaaaaaaaally late and, um, there's something else i need to do also. so it can wait!! i need sleep
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 15TH</b><br>
			i was feeling extremely anxious today (sort of oscillating in intensity) and spent way too much time on youtube trying to escape reality... i have calmed down a bit in the last few hours though, and did some work rewriting the about me page on this site, as well as updating some social media profiles (technically ""marketing?"" whatever). i also cleared out 1000+ emails today... really gotta stop letting those pile up. good thing 99% of it is unimportant lol. still, i didn't get too much done today. i don't wanna guilt trip myslef too much but overall this weekend has not been that great, both in terms of productivity and just personal enjoyment. i wanna try to rectify that in the future. tomorrow i'll start on the jam game a little, though i'll be busy with some other stuff. i'm thinking my original concept for a turn based game will be waaaaaaay too ambitious, so i'm thinkin' i'll redesign it into a top down shooter while keeping the core concept. i'll try to get basic moving at least, hopefully shooting.<br>
			also, i feel that i'm juggling too many projects at once. i haven't worked on walk the line in a while so i'm gonna put it on hiatus until the game jam is over, and then really focus on it for a week or two.

			<b>JANUARY 14TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on the jam game today, but i don't have much of an excuse this time. just wasn't feeling it. i think i'm going to take a sort of "break" from the game for the rest of this weekend (including monday which i have off)... as i talked about in my "why i suck at getting anything done" article, i don't want to feel like im behind and transform this into a source of internal guilt and shame. logically this is a meaningless gesture that just delays the project another day, but contextualizing it in my mind this way will really help me. at least i hope. writing these updates also helps a lot in the sense that i can recognize patterns / pitfalls more easily, and seeing them in front of me so clearly makes it easier to deal with them. but aside from all THAT, i worked on drawabox today! superimposed lines are finished :3 tomorrow i wanna actually draw THREE pages instead of just one. crazy, right?!? i could probably also work on walk the line a bit, i don't wanna leave it sittin' for too long.

			i had an unexpectedly busy day today, so i didn't even start on the game proper ;-; i DID do a lot of thinking and work on the design doc though. anyways im tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiired bye

			i made bridget jumper today. yahoo!! really not that amazing as you can tell but its a cute little project. i'm quite happy. next up: i've gotta get rollin on the pirate software game jam!!! it actually started TODAY, not tomorrow, i didn't realize! it's two weeks though so i've got some time. wish me luck :)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 11TH</b><br>
			had a very fun day today but i was honestly exhausted by the time i got home, so i didn't end up working on the bridget jumper again. i know i can still finish it (can honestly be made in a couple hours), so that'll wait for tomorrow. i wasn't planning to get too much done today due to fun times, so it's to be expected.<br>
			still, i did manage to do a sketch page today! paradoxically it looks bad, but i like looking at it. i drawabox is definitely a side project but i wanna up the anti on it a <i>little</i> bit, especially on days like today where my brain is really not in a problem solving sort of mood.
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 10TH</b><br>
			i didn't work on bridget jumper at ALL today... and my deadline is friday!!!!!!! ahhhhhh
			i shouldn't be procrastinating this much but i still think i can do it, it's a VERY simple meme game lol. still, i did work on the website a little today updating the links page and stuff, but i gotta get on it.
			to accomplish this, im gonna try a new challenge: no twitter, youtube, or reddit until the weekend. wish me luck!
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 9TH</b><br>
			shoulda done a little more workin and a little less youtube, but it's okay. worked more on bridget jumper... got hung up for a really long time on window scaling, which is all i ended up doing today :/ i remember it took my a while learning the first time, too, so i shouldn't be too harsh on myself. actually now that im looking at the time i did do an okay 1.5 hours so i guess that's not the worst, but i know i can to better!!!! >:)
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 8TH</b><br>
			i didn't realize until now, but there had been an issue with uploading the changes to git so this hasn't been uploaded for a few days. whoops!!! also... i was a day behind?!?!?! guess i skipped a day..? i can't believe it, i <i>swear</i> i wrote one every day but i can't seem to find anything missing in past commits..... i think what happened is that i accidentally wrote one in the wrong spot (not at the top), and in moving it i accidentally deleted one of the logs. maybe. regardless, i'll be more careful in the future >.<<br>
			<b>EDIT:</b> okay the problem was actually just the date on my computer was set one day forward (it messed up from when i booted into linux hehe...). as for what i ACTUALLY did today, i worked on the website for a good few hours! i fixed the chatbox (cbox -> chatango) and expanded the backrooms. yahoo!<br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 7TH</b><br>
			i felt unassually sad today, although i cheered up after going to a friends house c: as is propetually the case, i didn't get quite as much done as i was hoping... whatever!!!!! today i figured out how to "fix" environment variables with an autoexec script for powershell. the documentation is kinda terrible (no mention that i have to set a PATH and the actual variable!?!?!??!), but whatever... i managed, and i also got raylib compiling on windows again! yahoo! i've got a pretty funny (and easy) game idea hehe<br>
			but what took up most of my time today was just reorganizing my files (finally banished onedrive), and re-setting up some old applications i used to have on my old computer (im just gonna use notepad++ for a text editor, using vim on windows is a miserable experience i give up)
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 6TH</b><br>
			okay somethings gotta change. i said i was gonna work on something eles today, but im STILL in the linux mines trying to get things to work. both becasue of how much of a pain it's been and becasue im really not doing as much as i should be. im just gonna bite the bullet and work on windows for at LEAST the rest of this month - i've got an idea to fix environment variables: an autoexec powershell script!! should probably work...<br>
			(i technically did do a LITTLE bit of drawabox, but it was just rewatching the 50% rule because i forgot the guidelines. doens't really count).<br>
			also, i need to stop playin' guilty gear for a bit. i feel like im slowly becoming more hot-headed over time because im like "im playing a lot, i should be good!!!" kind of like im trying to compensate or something, and its making the game less fun and distracting me from my stuffffffffff. gr. also pirate software gamejam is next week oh god. i am not ready...<br>
			plan for tomorrow: make bridget jumper. or else.<br>
			(also also i REALLY need to fix my sleep schedule its 1:39 rn aaaaaaaa)

			<b>JANUARY 5th</b><br>
			all i worked on today was trying to set up linux mint, and MAN has it been a pain!! booting was pretty easy, but it's stuck in a super low 4:3 resolution and i can't change it ("unknown display"). gahhh! i guess this technically counts as working on a project cus its my "dev environment," but i think tomorrow i should take a break, maybe do some work on this website and walk the line.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 4TH</b><br>
			you know my sleep schedule is bad when it's the next day already by that time im writing this lol. didn't get as much done today as i would have liked, i kinda procrastinated until an hour before midnight (played don't starve for the first time)... but anyways, today i restarted on the drawabox lessons! i tried the course like 6 months ago but only did 5 or so pages. im choosing to start over since i did so little it didn't really stick.. it shouldn't take too long to make up, anyways. i did a page of super imposed lines! also, i didn't buy that usb flash drive but i found an old 32gb SD card, so i could probably just boot linux from that. it'll have to wait til tomorrow though.
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 3RD</b><br>
			<img src="jan3.png"><br>
			i made a lil' game today! the setup was super jank (for some reaosn linux mint wasn't working for awhile (i think i gave the VM too much memory??) AND build-essential still couldn't install. i think the iso i got has a different repository or something.. anyways, i went back to pop os since it's giving me less problems so far (although i prefer the windows style UI of mint. idk). i actually figured out how to build raylib - i was doing everything right except my makefile. i still don't know how to use make for this, but i realized using the "simplest possible build script" from the raylib wiki was pretty easy (just a 1 line bash file), so i did that and it worked!!! then i spent like 20 minutes making a veeeery simple clicker game.<br>
			holy crap i forgot how """strings""" and pointers work... but it was still pretty easy thanks to TextFormat(). still, i gotta relearn pointers.<br>
			tomorrow i wanna: 1) investigate a 3rd distro. i like the UI of mint but it's givin' me problems so idk (maybe im just an idiot) 2) get a good USB flash drive to boot from and that also has decent capacity (like 128gb or something). 3) start making a jumper game (like the chrome dinosaur game)

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 2ND</b><br>
			only worked about ~30 minutes today. i spent some more time looking into linux figuring out if i should duelboot on a single drive (i came to the conclusion that it's probably fine with a modern UEFI instead of a BIOS, should prevent windows update from messing up the partitions), but i need a usb drive to boot from. the one i have is only 16gb which isn't enough for linux mint :( (and it's really slow. probably like over 15 years old lol).<br>
			as for the work i actually did get done... well i started over since (this time with linux mint) im pretty sure i was doing everything wrong, and... can't fetch build-essential from the server!! im not sure what to do about that, but it didn't happen yesterday so i assume its cus the package servers are down? i could install git and neovim just fine though.. idk i'll try in a bit tomorrow. but yeah, trying to boot linux mint and troubleshooting that was literally all i did today. oh well<br>
			also, skiing kinda sucked >.<
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>JANUARY 1ST</b><br>
			didn't get as much done as i was hoping. there was sort of a shift in plans - i finally cracked and decided to start trying out linux after i tried AGAIN to get environment variables in windows 11 to work for like 1.5 hours, to no avail (seriously i have probably wasted like 5 hours total on this). so for the last hour-ish, i ran pop os in virtualbox and did all my work in there. i accidentally set it to scale mode and couldn't figure out how to unset it, so it was really strecthed lol. i downloaded and compiled raylib, but i couldn't figure out how to compile my c code, it kept saying all the raylib functions were missing so there must have been some issue with linking. i have no idea how c works lol. despite this, im still feeling alright... i'll probably keep working in a VM til' i finish this little game. i should probably duelboot linux and windows, using windows for gaming and linux for everything else, but that'll have to wait.<br>
			going skiing tommorrow (the snow season SUCKS this year, nothing til JANUARY!??!?!), so im not sure how much i'll get done... i'll do at least a little bit though!
		</p>

		<p class="entry">
			<b>DECEMBER 31, 2023</b><br>
			the new year technically hasn't started yet, but i wanna start the tradition. today i mainly worked on this website for ~2-3 hours i think, mainly focused on adding the new blog that i wrote yesterday along with the new machinations page (and updating the thing of the month, of course). tomorrow i'm going to try to get a super simple c dev environment setup with raylib + make, and make a super simple game, like a clicker or something. i also need to fix my vim config, syntax highlighting won't work for some reason .-.<br>
			wish me luck for the new year!
