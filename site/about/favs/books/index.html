				<em>Mistborn: The Final Empire</em><br>
				i was really impressed by every aspect of this book. despite being the first entry of a triology, it stands perfectly on its own as a great story which i admire. the magic system is the most interesting i've seen and the world felt like the logical outcome of that system - it was really well done. what really elevates this book for me though were the characters, vin's arc in particular was really memorable for me. also, the second and third books were quite good, especially the third, but... idk, something about <i>The Final Empire</i> just really resonated with me.
