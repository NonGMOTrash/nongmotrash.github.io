			these are my <i>extremely</i> long tf2 rebalance suggestions, made mostly during 2021-22 when i was playing quite actively. originally i intended this to just be a funy lil' thing i shared with the friends i played with, but as the changes started adding up, it basically morphed into my pretend master's thesis on multiplayer game design (except, y'know, all in lowercase). there's actually still some more work i was planning to do on it, if you can believe that, but i stopped playing tf2 and thus my interest in continuing this montrosity has fallen off. so, i'd decided i'd just drop it in here and call it done. i'm not sure how much the average person can get from this (nothing. the answers nothing), but if you like tf2, this might be interesting. feel free to use the outline to skip around to a section you're interested in.
		</p>

		<p><span class="sidenote">
			you may have noticed this has been sitting in the scrapbook for a while.<br>
			originally, i was going to release a short story i've been cookin up this month (walk the line), but i haven't worked on it nearly as much as i'd have liked, so it'll have to wait until around christmas. however, i've been trying really hard to have at least SOMETHING i release every month, so this is just sort of an easy thing for november. hopefully i'll have something more substanial to for december!
		</span></p>

<!-- pasted content begins here -->
<h1 id="opening">Opening</h1>
<p>This is not meant to be a down to earth, generally agreeable list of
changes that I would actually implement into TF2. I think the already
existing balance mods from hiGPS, Kingo, and Fsoas do an okay job at
that (if a bit hit and miss). Their changes are more conservative and
inline with TF2’s existing design.</p>
<p>instead, this is a more of a complete reimagining, overhauling the
fundamental foundations of classes and game modes that have existed for
over a decade. This is far beyond what would be reasonable for a major
update both in feasibility and reception; rather, this is more suitable
for a sequel. adding on to this idea, i came up with a new weapon
concept for every slot for each class.</p>
<p>If I was in charge of designing a sequel to TF2, this would be my
first draft.</p>
<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>
<p>TF2, on the whole, is a very well designed game. I don't want to
change for the sake of change, trying to fix what isn’t broken.</p>
<p>Instead, I use this list of principles to justify every decision in
this document. You may not agree with these principles, or how I choose
to apply them, but these can help you understand my thought process so
you atleast know where I'm coming from.</p>
<p>I also realize that drafting up a huge list of complaints like this
is highly prone to personal bias, so having a set of principles to guide
my changes helps reduce that and maintain a consistent internal
logic.</p>
<h2 id="cost-balancing">Cost Balancing</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>the impact (or power) of something should be determined by its
‘cost’, which can be judged by four factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>EXECUTION:</strong> if an action is requires a high
degree of dexterity, it should be rewarded accordingly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some examples: headshots, direct pipes, chaining rockets</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RESOURCE:</strong> if an action requires time, ammo,
ubercharge, metal, or whatever, then it should have a greater impact</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some examples: building a level 3 sentry, charging an
uber</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RISK:</strong> if an action requires you to put yourself
more at risk, it's impact should scale accordingly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some examples: scattergun meatshots, backstabs, the
kritzkrieg</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SPECIALIZATION:</strong> the more situational something
is, the more impactful it should be in those specialized situations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some examples: the direct hit, rescue ranger, cloak and
dagger</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="counterplay">Counterplay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>players should have a strong ability to respond to the actions of
their opponent</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ensuring both players always have agency makes things feel fair
even if you’re losing, which is vital for making a competitive
multiplayer game fun.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="casual-vs-competitive-focus">Casual vs Competitive Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>balancing should be done for both casual and competitive, not
just one or the other.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I really dislike a lot of the discussions I've seen in the
community about the casual vs competitive sides of the game as they
usually come with the implication that one side needs to completely push
out the other.</p></li>
<li><p>My stance on this is twofold: both casual 12v12 and competitive
6v6 are played, and that's <em>never</em> going to change. arbitrarily
deeming one side more important and completely disregarding the other
completely fails to serve the playerbase. The aim should be to make
things work well at <em>all</em> levels of play.</p></li>
<li><p>The counter argument here is that competitive TF2 has different
rules than casual, in contrast to most other games like say, csgo, that
are functionally the same at all levels. it’s difficult or impossible to
make things balanced for both 12v12 <em>and</em> 6v6, so it’d be better
just to opt for one. I agree with this to some extent, it's undeniably a
tough design problem – but I think it’s a problem that’s both possible
and worthwhile to solve.</p></li>
<li><p>For one, the vast majority of weapons and mechanics work fine in
both formats. The RGL 6s ruleset only bans <em>21</em> weapons out of
158, and that number is getting smaller as the seasons roll by. it’s not
as big a problem as it might seem. Furthermore, I think it’s definitely
possible to make these banned unlocks work in both casual and
competitive, as long as you remain conscientious of both sides (which
valve has <em>really</em> dropped the ball on).</p></li>
<li><p>and for all the problems that this split brings, consider the
benefits! These two sides of the game are mutually beneficial to each
other. even in more competitively centered games, everyone starts as a
casual, so supporting those newer players will inevitably help the
competitive scene. Likewise, the competitive community also benefits the
casual end by drawing more people to the game with the exposure and
prestige that tournaments bring.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There's a reason why super smash bros has been so successful,
both casually and competitively, in the fighting game genre which is
traditionally very niche.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The success of competitive smash, in my mind, is a glaring silver
bullet against the idea that TF2 can’t or shouldn’t be competitive. it
wasn’t intended to be played competitively, and it requires tweaking to
make it suitable for competition, but who cares? It's undeniably a great
competitive game, and that doesn’t infringe on the casual
experience.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There aren't many FPS games that appeal to both sides of the
spectrum – most shooters are either notorious for they’re harsh, toxic
communities, or are just not deep enough to garner a competitive scene.
if TF2 could fill that role better, it could be vastly more
successful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ideal-competitive-format">The Ideal Competitive Format</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>is <strong>unrestricted 6s</strong>. here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fast and easy matchmaking:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>only 6 players, and they don’t have to be playing any specific
combination of classes.</p></li>
<li><p>also makes LAN events &amp; a potential esports scene are more
practical. a sponsor only has to pay for 6 people to fly up to a
tournament as opposed to 9.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>fewer players makes each individual kill more impactful</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this raises the stakes and makes the game more exciting</p></li>
<li><p>it’s also much more manageable to cast, making 6s is a generally
better spectator experience</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>it's an easier jump from casual compared to traditional 6s or
Highlanders that have heaps of rules.</p></li>
<li><p>it leaves the most room for creative strategies with no
limitations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To clarify, I understand why the competitive community plays with
class limits and weapon bans <em>right now</em>. there’s quite a few
completely unbalanced items and strategies that would pretty much ensure
every game would end in a stalemate.</p></li>
<li><p>That said, I don't believe it should be the competitive
community’s job to patch over all the broken parts of the game. Those
should be addressed directly by the developers. One of the main goals of
this document is to try and address the causes for class limits and
weapon bans so that they aren’t needed anymore.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>why would you only support a single format, rather than both 6s
and Highlander?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>I think it’s possible (and better) to have a single
format that everyone can agree on.</strong> It might seem strange that I
choose a single format as the defacto standard, when I argued that both
casual and competitive need to be supported since they will both always
be played. shouldn’t 6s and Highlander both be supported for that same
reason?</p></li>
<li><p>my rationale is that <strong>Highlander wouldn’t be played
competitively if the game’s problems were actually fixed</strong>. The
reason why people choose Highlander is that it allows specialist classes
to be run consistently, and has fewer weapons banned. Of course, i can’t
speak for the entire Highlander community so feel free to come to your
own conclusion. but the general consensus I gather is that 9v9 class
limit 1 really isn’t all that great, but the restrictions imposed by 6s
make the game feel really watered down and prevent people from playing
TF2 the way they want to. if 6s didn’t have those problems, nobody would
be playing Highlander competitively.</p></li>
<li><p>That said, those criticisms of 6s aren’t unfounded, and I
definitely see the benefits of Highlander. That's why I think
<strong>competition could be made better for <em>everyone</em> by
bringing the good parts of Highlander into 6s.</strong> That way, the
community is unified under one format, and there’s no fragmentation for
tournaments, prize money, balancing, and community support.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Prolander"><u>Prolander</u></a>
attempts to strike a balance between traditional 6s and Highlander… I
think it has some good ideas, but enforcing a class limit of one is too
restrictive. It ultimately has the same problem as Highlander, just to a
lesser extent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preventing-stalemates">Preventing Stalemates</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>there should never be stalemates (situations where the optimal
play for both teams is to just hold the choke or wait for a pick)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>related to this, <strong>there should be no "defense"
classes</strong>. Of course, some classes will inevitably be stronger at
holding a position, but they should also have other applications beyond
just holding ground. Furthermore, their defensive capabilities should
always be slightly weaker than the equivalent offensive capabilities of
the other team. This helps ensure that the game is always moving
forward.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The classes are now categorized as <strong>power</strong>,
<strong>pick</strong>, and <strong>support</strong>. These terms more
accurately describe their actual class role, and are broadly accepted by
the community.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-identity">Class Identity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>classes should play in a way that is unique to them and refrain
from blending together</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My attitude towards this is that classes can have similar roles,
as long as they perform them in different ways. <strong>it’s the
<em>means</em> that needs to be kept distinct, not the
end.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For example, one could argue that giving pyro greater mobility
and higher burst damage would be bad because it infringes on what the
scout was created for. but i think that’s a fairly surface level
similarity, it just means they’re both close range pick
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about the other 2 pick classes: spy and sniper. they can
both instantly kill a high priority target, yes, but they achieve that
in such radically different ways that they feel completely
different.</p></li>
<li><p>The same goes for the previous example. a scout meatshotting a
medic and then escaping with a double jump is way different from a pyro
flare comboing a medic and then airblasting to cover an escape. Having
classes that are vaguely in the same role isn’t something to be
concerned about.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bespoke-weapon-design">Bespoke Weapon Design</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>all unlockable weapons should change the way you play in a way
that’s different from all the other options in that slot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The entire point of unlockable weapons is to give new ways to
play. It's not enough to have weapons that occasionally help or hurt you
depending on the situation you’re in. The difference has to be
meaningful enough that you actually play around it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="depth-vs-complexity">Depth vs Complexity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>changes should aim to <strong>maximize depth</strong> and
<strong>minimize complexity</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>depth is the amount of gameplay variety and skill expression
(good), and complexity is the amount of rules and things you have to
learn (bad).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the complexity that’s especially problematic is that which is
frontloaded (something you have to learn it before you can play the game
at even a basic level)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>TF2 generally does a great job at avoiding this. The long list of
unlockable weapons might seem fatally complex on paper, but it's quite
manageable because you only need to start with 3 stock weapons to start
having fun.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This is why I often remove a lot of seemingly innocuous stats
from weapons. if they don’t add any depth, they aren’t worth the
additional complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they might not seem <em>that</em> complicated because if you’re
experienced, and they sort of aren’t. experienced players know that they
don’t matter and just ignore them, and often forget their even there.
but a new player reading a weapon’s stats for the first time won’t
realize that, so having a bunch of nothing stats just obfuscates what’s
actually important.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="minimize-randomness">Minimize Randomness</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>TF2 already achieves chaotic casual fun just by having such a
massive range of playstyles, skill levels, and people in a given game –
not to mention its eccentric art style and the absurd concepts for
weapons and gamemodes. Randomness isn't needed to uphold that, it will
only irritate experienced players who expect to be rewarded with
consistent results for their skills.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="snowballing-drawbacks">Snowballing Drawbacks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Snowballing weapons must have some downside or limitation even
once they are in that positive feedback loop. otherwise, they often
become just a straight upgrade in casual for anyone who is good at the
class, because they can farm less experienced players to negate the
downside.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The bazaar bargain, eyelander, and diamondback are all examples
of this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simple-stock-weapons">Simple Stock Weapons</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>stock weapons should never have unique attributes. i.e, if
something applies to the stock rocket launcher, it should apply to all
rocket launchers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is for the sake of accessibility. stock is what new players
start with and should therefore be the simplest option. Having a
straightforward baseline also makes it easier to learn the unlockable
variants later.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>the principles below are lower priority and shouldn’t be upheld
at the cost of the above principles</em></p>
<h2 id="maximize-playstyle-variety">Maximize Playstyle Variety</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>team composition and weapon loadouts should be as varied as
possible in both casual and competitive, within reason.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A big part of the skepticism towards the competitive scene (6s
especially) comes from the stale meta.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand and fully agree with the notion that <em>player
playing</em> is what makes the game interesting, not the
<em>character</em> they control – and competitive TF2 absolutely excels
on that front.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevertheless, I also agree with those who criticize the meta.
Even if the player expression is king, character expression is queen and
her throne is right next to his. competitive would be even better if
there was more variety in team composition and playstyles.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uphold-weapon-identity">Uphold Weapon Identity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The stats of a weapon should reflect its theme or ‘identity’
where possible, whether that’s the name and design of the item, or the
reputation it’s garnered among the community.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I try not to replace a weapon with an entirely new design unless
it’s so fundamentally flawed that a rework is necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="universal-changes">Universal Changes</h1>
<h2 id="remove-random-crits">Remove Random Crits</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>because <a href="#minimize-randomness"><u>randomness should be
minimized</u></a>, and they aren't necessary to break stalemates (uber
does that much better), and they aren't a very good way to make melee
weapons viable beyond utility. basically <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHvwijT2ss8"><u>everything</u>
<u>ancle</u> <u>dane said</u></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remove-stuns-slows">Remove Stuns &amp; Slows</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>because this restricts the movement of the other player so
drastically, i feel it doesn't allow for adequate <a
href="#counterplay"><u>counterplay</u></a>. even if balanced, it’s just
not fun to play against.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is only relevant when it restricts the opponents
counterplay, so exceptions can be made for the <a
href="#holiday-punch"><u>holiday punch</u></a> and items that give self
inflicted slowness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="replace-damage-resvuln">Replace Damage Res/Vuln</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>all<strong>*</strong> damage resistances and vulnerabilities are
replaced with health changes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this makes it easier to gage the difference at a glance without
having to pull out a calculator</p>
<ul>
<li><p>* The exception is general damage resistances that are only
sometimes active, like the battalion’s backup charge. it would be really
confusing and weird to give a temporary max health boost, so i keep
those as is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>resistances to specific damage types don't allow for enough
counterplay in a casual environment. Every class relies heavily on a
single damage type, and relying on teammates to take care of specific
targets isn’t fun because it doesn’t give you much agency.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>crit resistance</strong>: while not quite as bad as
damage resistance, it suffers from the same lack of counterplay. certain
classes and loadouts (sniper, demoknight, items like the kritzkrieg,
buff banner, flare gun, ext) get completely shut down by crit resistance
with little counterplay.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="afterburn-rework">Afterburn Rework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>note that some weapons apply afterburn differently (see the <a
href="#pyro"><u>pyro section</u></a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> igniting an enemy will deal an instant burst
of 30 damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>extra general burst damage gives pyro more pick potential. This
makes the class more useful outside of defense, instead of encouraging
pyro to stay back and slow down the game.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a nice buff to pyro, as there’s a lot of combos that
don’t actually kill and rely on a few extra ticks of afterburn.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> medics on fire will have a -50% medigun heal
rate debuff (24h/s → 12h/s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allowing the pyro to debuff the enemy medic gives them a way to
support the team in large fights despite their inferior damage compared
to the other combat classes.</p></li>
<li><p>There's still counterplay on the medic's end as they can fallback
to an extinguishing source, ask their team for one, or use other sources
of healing like the crossbow or overdose that aren't affected by the
debuff. also, even though medics heal slower, they still build uber at
the same rate so it won’t slow down the game.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> afterburn damage: 5% of targets
<em>current</em> health each tick, clamped between 1 and 12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here's a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xZjUHV4"><u>graph</u></a>
of how this compares to TF2’s current afterburn.</p></li>
<li><p>The rationale behind this is that dying to afterburn is pretty
annoying, so making the time to kill much longer will alleviate
that.</p></li>
<li><p>but despite the annoyance on the receiving end, afterburn damage
really isn’t all that great for the pyro because it doesn’t do enough
damage to help them in the fight most of the time. at best, you’ll kill
someone after you’re already dead if the fight was really
close.</p></li>
<li><p>This damage rework improves the short term damage to a level that
is more useful as chip damage before you engage. For example, if you hit
a flare on a full health heavy, they’ll take ~75 damage after just 3
seconds! It also gives pyro a new niche as a great anti overheal
class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed reduced healing received from
mediguns, dispensers, and the payload</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is barely noticeable as these sources remove afterburn after
~1 second, but removing this just simplifies things. The reduction to
medigun healing stat above is my replacement for this that’s actually
impactful.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, this mechanic is listed as a -20% reduction in the patch
notes, but for some reason the actual strength is inversely proportional
to the heal rate of the source (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHNmkYh5HU"><u>explanation</u></a>).
it’s really unintuitive, which is another reason to remove it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="universal-melee-buff">Universal Melee Buff</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>all melee's can do the gunslinger 3-hit-crit combo, excluding
weapons with that previously had the “no random crits” stat.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this should actually work on the 3rd hit every time.</p></li>
<li><p>melee's are too skewed toward utility instead of offensive damage
in my opinion. there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with utility melee's, i
just feel that melee should have more value for actually doing damage.
That way, the offensive melees can actually be viable, and the damage
and swing speed penalties employed by the utility melees are actually
impactful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remove-spawning-wallhacks">Remove Spawning Wallhacks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>refers to the outline around teammates that appears when you
spawn.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a problem because it can give away disguised spies, and
doesn’t really add anything. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjsB9OosHX8"><u>This video</u></a>
elaborates more on the subject.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crit-stacking">Crit Stacking</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>the damage bonus from crits now stacks additively:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>mini crit + mini crit = <strong>double mini crit
(+70%)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>crit + mini cirt = <strong>ultra crit (+235%)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>crit + crit = <strong>double crit (+500%)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>This is a very situational buff to items like the kritzkrieg and
buff banner that I don't think will be worth it most of the time, but it
should open up the potential for some wacky combos.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resupply-cooldown">Resupply Cooldown</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>all resupply cabinets have a 15 second cooldown.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The last points, in general, are way too difficult to push. part
of this is a map design problem for sure, but i do think having such a
powerful, easy resource always available is part of the problem. Things
like buildings, short circuit blasts, the rescue ranger, jarate, mad
milk, and more can all be spammed without the resource costs they are
meant to have.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This change should get the rescue ranger unbanned. it’s only a
problem because you can tank a sentry on last with the infinite metal
from the resupply.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remove-bloom">Remove Bloom</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>remove random bullet spread on shotguns</p>
<ul>
<li><p>because <a href="#minimize-randomness"><u>randomness should be
minimized</u></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanna make it clear that I think this issue has been pretty
overblown in the community on both sides. it really doesn't matter
<em>that</em> much since there's so many pellets that the randomness
basically evens out the vast majority of the time. it’s only really
consistently noticeable at longer range, where the variance in chip
damage is so small it doesn’t really matter. When people blame bullet
spread, it’s often just because they weren’t being quite as accurate as
they could have been.</p></li>
<li><p>Even still, I don't see how this really adds anything. it's just
a slight inconsistency on damage that can screw you over, albeit very
rarely.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remove-projectile-blocking">Remove Projectile Blocking</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>teammates should never block projectiles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it feels really unsatisfying, is largely out of your control, and
doesn’t really help to reduce spam as the past 15 years have
proven.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="switch-speed-fix">Switch Speed Fix</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the ability to bypass switch speed penalties by rapidly
switching between weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes switch speed penalties always meaningful, rather than
an arbitrary knowledge barrier you have to learn about in order to
bypass.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="normalize-fall-damage">Normalize Fall Damage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>fall damage should be 100% consistent (in the game currently it’s
random within a certain range)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this really isn’t a huge deal at all, but randomness should be
minimized and this adds nothing, so it’s removed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="collision-hull-fix">Collision Hull Fix</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>collision hulls are now a cylinder shape, with a flat top and
bottom rather than a cube.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current collision hulls have a small problem in that they
don’t change orientation. This results in some weird quirks, like having
a ‘wider’ projectile hitbox depending on the direction you’re being shot
from, or not being able to walk as closely along some walls that collide
with the corner of the box.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="heavy">Heavy</h1>
<p>the problems with heavy i'd like to address are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>lack of skill expression</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>aiming the minigun really isn’t <em>that</em> deep. a 100 hour
heavy is going to put out pretty similar damage compared to a 1000 hour
one. positioning and game sense are very important on heavy, but they
are also important on every single class.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't buy the argument that positioning on heavy is more
complex compared to other classes because he's too slow to reposition.
In fact the opposite is often true. Because he is slow, he’s extremely
limited in offensive maneuverability and instead has to sit and wait for
enemies to come to him. Many holds have a clear best spot to stand as
heavy, whereas every other class (even sniper) can and is required to
switch up their positioning based on the situation to perform
optimally.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>overly defensive playstyle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is bad because it slows down games. it’s why 6s rulesets
basically do everything in their power to prevent a heavy from getting
to mid.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>weakness in high level play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>being slow in a heavily movement based shooter is a debilitating
weakness, but to compensate heavy has worse damage* and pick potential
than the other power classes on top of that.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>* Of course, heavy players easily have the highest dps, but
that’s only really useful against bad players who are out of position.
People with good gamesense will know to avoid prolonged exposure to
minigun fire, which makes it difficult for heavy to get anything
done.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>lack of playstyle variety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This isn’t as bad on heavy as it is for some other classes as
there are some alternative strategies and items that really do switch
things up. The problem is more that they kinda suck and aren’t really
viable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> mini guns deal increasingly more base damage
on successive shots: 9 → 14 over 2.5 seconds of fire. Completely missing
for 0.315 seconds straight (12 bullets) will reset this, but getting a
kill will grant a 0.8 second grace period, giving you time to switch
targets.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there should be some sort of visual indication on the gun itself
or on the bullets to show this damage boost.</p></li>
<li><p>This should give heavy more room for skill expression, with the
potential for a threatening damage output even at mid range, putting
heavy on par with the other power classes.</p></li>
<li><p>However, this requires extremely consistent tracking, so heavy
won’t be more powerful at lower skill levels where the class is already
pretty strong. it also doesn’t invalidate heavy’s usual counterplay,
heavy still has poor burst damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 1 of the 4 minigun bullets fired per shot
will always be 100% accurate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows heavies to consistently make use of the damage scaling
mechanic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> melee damage: 65 → 100</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it's so difficult to get in melee range with heavy because
they’re the slowest class in the game. heavy <em>needs</em> this
absurdly high melee damage in order for stock, and melee in general, to
be consistently useful. this also helps make buffalo steak heavy
viable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed reduced minigun damage to level 2 / 3
sentries</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All this does is make it harder to push with heavy, shoehorning
the class into a defensive playstyle which I'm trying to avoid (see the
class problems above).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> the high noon taunt now uses a hitbox instead
of a single hitscan ray, making it much more consistent to hit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is mainly useful for the <a href="#holiday-punch"><u>holiday
punch</u></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> the sandvich is now heavy’s stock secondary,
replacing the shotgun</p>
<ul>
<li><p>shotgun heavy is fun, and i would like to make it more viable,
but i think it’s definitely a more of an alternative playstyle. stock
weapons should be more suited toward the typical game plan of the class,
and for heavy secondaries, nothing fits that bill better than the
sandvich.</p></li>
<li><p>This does mean that the stock shotgun can no longer be used on
heavy. I think this is fine because the family business is essentially a
straight upgrade to stock anyways, and I intend to keep it that way.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>heavy has a hard time getting use out of the shotguns, more so
than any of the other classes that have them, because miniguns
completely overshadow them in damage at the same range. Using a shotgun
does afford you a modicum of increased mobility, but overall it’s
definitely not nearly as useful for heavy.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this, I think having heavy’s shotgun (the family
business) to be straight up better than the other shotguns like it is
now is actually pretty reasonable. but since that’s the case, the stock
shotgun is completely redundant, so i opted to remove it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natascha">Natascha</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>currently banned in 6v6</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> this weapon mini crits when below 50%
ammo</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> -25% damage → -20%, and now only applies when
above 50% ammo</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The weapon should glow when below half ammo, so that enemies can
see when the mini crits are ready.</p></li>
<li><p>These upsides are interesting and drastically change how you
play. normally ammo management on heavy is only a minor issue, but this
design turns the concept on its head by daring you to drain your
ammo.</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t really fit the weapon’s old theme, but there’s not
really a good way to have a minigun that debuffs enemies because it’s
not reasonable to dodge a constant stream of bullets, so there’s not
enough counterplay.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed slow on hit</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#remove-stuns-slows"><u>I'm removing all effects like
this</u></a>. It really limits the opponent’s counterplay, and is
especially egregious on a mini gun. replaced with the new upsides. This
completely removes the mechanical identity of this weapon, but it’s
egregious enough that i feel it’s necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 20% damage resistance during spin up
while below half health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I feel this attribute should be unique to a single minigun. it’s
a much better fit for the defensive playstyle of the brass beast, so i
choose to remove it from this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brass-beast">BRASS BEAST</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> damage resistance: 20% → 50%</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> damage resistance applies even when above
half health, but it doesn’t apply after you’re already spun up, only
while revving</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The +20% damage bonus isn’t worth it most of the time, because
you’ll take a lot more damage than you’ll dish out from the bonus during
your long rev up.</p></li>
<li><p>It's difficult to compensate for this by revving preemptively
because you’re hardly able to move while revved.</p></li>
<li><p>speeding up the rev time slightly would be one way to buff the
weapon, but it’d also kind of under its defensive playstyle and make it
more similar to stock, so it’s not the <em>best</em> change.</p></li>
<li><p>it’s more interesting, i think, to expand on the defensive bonus
while revving. it’d solve the issue of taking too much damage before you
can even start firing, without taking away from the downsides that are
core to the weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>I do think that it’s better to have the damage resistance
<em>not</em> apply after revving though, both for balance, and because I
think it encourages extremely stale playstyles where you just never
unrev. Playing like a sentry isn’t very dynamic or exciting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tomislav">Tomislav</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A generally good idea and well balanced, but it’s too similar to
stock. i opted for more exaggerated upsides and downsides.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> base damage: 9 → 23 (+250%)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -20% slower firing speed (8.33/s →
9.5/s)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> bullets per shot: 4 → 1 (effectively a 75%
slower firing speed)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bear in mind, <a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>the single bullet
fired for each shot is always perfectly accurate</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>This makes the tomislav play very different from the other
miniguns. instead of having slightly lower dps, being slightly more
demanding to aim, but slightly better at range, all of those attributes
are now ramped up to the extreme.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="huo-long-heater">Huo-Long Heater</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> the ring of fire now only appears in a single
burst after you rev up, rather than repeatedly. it deals 80 damage, and
consumes 30 ammo.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ring of fire is pretty superfluous with its current
implementation because at the range where enemies get hit by it, heavy
already has the highest dps in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Burst damage, on the other hand, is actually something heavy
struggles with, so having a weapon that helps you out with that is more
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, this design is much more interesting. The vanilla
ring of fire kind of encourages hyper defensive strategies that
necessitate that you stay near ammo at all times, whereas this new one
encourages more aggressive and dynamic play with ambushes and
whatnot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> -10% damage → -15% damage, but only to non
burning targets</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This punishes you for playing like you would with stock and
rewards you for using the ring of fire.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="dalokohs-bar">Dalokohs Bar</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> max health gained: 50 → 80 (+80)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An extra 50 health on heavy really isn’t all that great since the
class is such a damage sponge. it <em>does</em> let you survive an extra
rocket or pipe, but that usually only makes a difference in a 1v1 which
heavy rarely engages in. This stronger buff should be enough to make a
more noticeable difference against general spam.</p></li>
<li><p>It also allows fully overhealed dalokah’s heavies to survive a
fully charged headshot with the damage increase to 540 (see <a

<h2 id="buffalo-steak-sandwich">Buffalo Steak Sandwich</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p>Terrible for actually punching people, but can be used to get a
fast rollout without sacrificing health which is why it's
banned.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>Heavy</u> <u>melee is</u>
<u>much stronger now</u></a> with a base 100 damage, which makes the
mini crits this grants actually powerful because it’s capable of
one-shotting light classes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 20% damage vulnerability while the
effect is active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going melee only as one of the slowest classes in the game is
already a sufficient enough risk for the reward this weapon offers, so a
damage vulnerability on top of that is overkill.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> while the effect is active, bunny hopping
will increase your base speed by 4% each jump, up to a max of +28% (105%
total). this resets once you stop bunny hopping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +23% speed boost while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For this to work offensively, it needs to provide a way to close
the gap on enemies since he’s the slowest class in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>However, giving just a base faster walk speed at no cost is a big
problem since it allows heavies to roll out quickly for free. adding a
high skill cost to this makes it more balanced and inline with
teleporters (resource cost) and the GRU (less impact).</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="the-brick">★ The Brick</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A new secondary weapon for heavy.</p></li>

<li><p>an slow, arcing projectile that deals 120 damage (no falloff)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>holding down left click will wind up the throw, making it travel
further</p></li>
<li><p>120 damage is balanced because heavy doesn’t really have a quick
way to deal the last 5 damage to finish off light classes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>alt fire:</strong> drops the brick on the ground for
teammates or yourself. It's equivalent to a full ammo pack.</p></li>
<li><p>it has a 14 second recharge after use</p></li>
<li><p>This gives heavy a strong, but limited long range option. Similar
to how the cleaver and wrap assassin open up a long range niche for
scouts, I hope a weapon like this could fill a similar role.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -60 max health (300 → 240)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I prefer this to the damage vulnerability while active. It means
that normal heavies who want to use this have to make a meaningful

<li><p>There's no penalty for quickly switching right as you take
damage, but there’s harsh punishment for holding it out any longer than
you need to. This fosters more skill expression, since you can switch
quickly to minimize the health drain, whereas a drain when switching is
unavoidable.</p></li>

<h1 id="demoman">Demoman</h1>
<p>I'd say the demo is in a pretty good place overall, he’s the only

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Demoknight is flawed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The subclass is simultaneously both bad, but also kind of
annoying. sentries and airblast completely shut down demoknight with no
recourse. but at the same time, trying to actually kill a demoknight can
feel impossible (especially with the eyelander) because they can
seemingly escape anything with their tankiness and speed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-1">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> sword damage: 65 → 75 (+10)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In isolation, this change is sort of overkill, but it makes more
sense within the broader context of the demoknight changes. The goal is
to drastically increase pick potential, in exchange for a huge sacrifice
to survivability which is the annoying aspect of the subclass.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> stickies have a 50% larger hurtbox to
remove</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's pretty slow to remove stickies with most weapons since you
need to be really precise. The demo can just keep planting more faster
than they can be shot down. This change tips the scales a little, making
it easier to push through chokepoints, and encouraging demos to be more
tactical and subtle about their trap placement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loch-n-load">Loch-N-Load</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +20% damage now applies to everything, not

<ul>
<li><p>This gives the loch n load general applicability – like it was
before gun metal – without being too broken. The base damage is now 120,
so you can’t quit one shot light classes, but the extra damage is still
very strong.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a grenade launcher that’s <em>only</em> better at dealing
with sentries is pretty hard to make viable. For normal demos, stickies
(and the stock grenade launcher) are already very strong against
sentries, so it’s not really necessary. Hybrid knights <em>do</em>
struggle with sentries more, but it’s usually better for them to opt for
a more generally applicable grenade launcher because they don’t have
stickies to cover the weaknesses of their primary. Unless the damage to
buildings was dialed up to an unfair level, this weapon’s current design
isn’t going to be very appealing to anyone.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iron-bomber">Iron Bomber</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently this is way too similar to stock, it needs a more
unique identity. There's different ways you could interpret the weapon’s
theme, but I choose to make this into an aggressive grenade launcher
for… well, bombing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> this weapon mini crits while blast
jumping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this doubles down on this item’s utility for grenade jumping, by
rewarding you greatly for bombing into people.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 15% smaller explosion radius</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is basically meaningless – it’s too subtle to make a
real difference in almost any situation. replaced with the new
downside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> 30% shorter fuse time → -30% self damage
(knockback unaffected)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both of these stats help with grenade jumping, but I think
reduced self damage is more unambiguously favorable for that purpose. a
shorter fuse time also helps a lot with spam, so it partially distracts
from this the iron bomber’s identity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 50% slower reload speed (1.24s / 0.6s → 1.8s
/ 0.9.s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The iron bomber needs a meaningful downside to have a distinct
role compared to stock. One option is to bump up the current explosion
radius reduction so that it’s actually impactful, but I feel this would
be boring since the loch-n-load has basically the same weakness. i opted
for this instead.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loose-cannon">Loose Cannon</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon is indirectly nerfed because <a
href="#remove-stuns-slows"><u>nothing can inflict slow anymore</u></a>,
so targets hit by the cannon balls can actually air strafe and surf them
which adds some counterplay. I don't see this impacting the weapon’s
power much though.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> double donks have no falloff, dealing 130
damage flat.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This fixes double donks sometimes dealing 124 damage, not giving
the reward that they should. This weapon is already so situational and
challenging, so removing this disappointing fake out aspect would make
it feel better to use without buffing it too drastically.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> cannot double donk buildings</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is needed to preserve this weapon’s ineffectiveness
against buildings with their <a href="#class-wide-changes-6"><u>new lack
of crit resistance</u></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tapdancer">★ Tapdancer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A new grenade launcher for demoman</p></li>
<li><p>I got the name from a similar idea on /r/TF2weaponideas, but i
can’t find it now</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> pipes bounce off surfaces instead of rolling
(like skipping a rock). they can bounce multiple times, losing ~⅓ of the
velocity each time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This lets you make shots you couldn’t before. you could skip it
on the ground to get some extra distance, or you could bounce it off a
wall to hit around a corner. it opens up new possibilities and changes
how you play.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 40% slower firing speed (0.6s → 0.84s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a significant weakness to balance out the significant
perk. it also plays into the bounce mechanic; more time between shots
gives you more time to line up a bounce shot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chagrin-targe">Chagrin’ Targe</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +35 max health</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#replace-damage-resvuln"><u>replacement for

for full demoknight).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> passive knockback resistance: +75%</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> all resistances removed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I choose to have the charge n target as the only shield with any
defensive buffs. I feel a boost of even just 1 health would somewhat
infringe on the chargin’ targe, since 200 is an important damage
threshold.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tide-turner">Tide Turner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> damage taken while charging will not reduce
the charge duration. rather, taking any single hit that deals more than
80 damage will instantly end the charge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> passive knockback resistance: +75%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes charging at people a bit more viable, though still
much weaker compared to the other shields (no knockback resistance).
This is more intended for hybrid knights.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> all resistances removed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I choose to have the charge n target as the only shield with any
defensive buffs. I feel even a boost of 1 health would somewhat infringe
on the charging target, since 200 is an important damage
threshold.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottle">Bottle</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I decided to keep this the same, rather than buffing it like most
other stock melees. because demoman’s secondaries are basically a second
primary, i feel demo’s melees should be weaker to compensate (the swords
are the exception, because they require a big commitment).</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, because Demo is so prone to getting rushed down, he
actually gets more use out of his melee than most classes, so a buff
isn’t really necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ullapool-caber">Ullapool Caber</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes inspired by <a href="https://badweaponrehab.tf"><u>bad
weapon rehab</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> explosion damage: 75 → 85</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allows the caber to <em>consistently</em> one shot light classes,
but not medics which is what got it nerfed. This also makes the caber
deal more self damage, which gives it a slightly higher risk to balance
this out, and make it comparable to the stock bottle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consistently being the keyword – i know you can one shot
lightclasses if you get the <em>absolute</em> maximum ramp up, but
that’s effectively random because that depends on the orientation of the
enemy’s collusion hull which is invisible, and impossible to get around
in certain corridors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> recharges from ammo packs (1 full pack, 2
medium packs, or 5 small packs)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allows caberknight to be viable since you don’t have to waste a
massive portion of your time running back to resupply.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> mini crits with shield charges</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes it consistent with other melees, and also helps to make
caberknight with the tide turner potentially viable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> this weapon crits while blast jumping, but
only when swung directly at an enemy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Direct” as in you melee the enemy, not just hit them with the
explosion.</p></li>
<li><p>Makes this into a market gardener style weapon that’s a bit more
unique and fitting for the demo.</p></li>
<li><p>Making the crit occur <em>only on direct hits</em> is very
important. otherwise, you could essentially suicide bomb at people and
easily insta kill them just from the explosion. This would be too strong
for sacing for the medic in competition. if the crit only occurs if you
hit them directly, it’s basically the same as a market garden, which is
a strategy that’s allowed.</p></li>

<h2 id="eyelander">Eyelander</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-1"><u>swords now deal
80</u> <u>damage</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> max health no longer increases with heads</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In casual (the only place where demoknight is viable), the
eyelander is completely busted in the hands of a good demoknight and
none of the other swords even come close, so it needs some sort of nerf.
removing the health boost is the best fit, because <a

<h2 id="scottmens-skullcutter">Scottmen’s Skullcutter</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> attacks also strike nearby enemies for half
the damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Similar to sweeping edge in minecraft (also this is my friend’s
rebalance idea)</p></li>
<li><p>This gives the skullcutter a unique application that opens up new
opportunities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +20% damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When combined <a href="#class-wide-changes-1"><u>buff to

<em>96</em> base damage which is pretty much impossible to balance, so i
deemed a new upside to be necessary</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="claidheamh-mor">Claidheamh Mor</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-1"><u>swords now deal
80</u> <u>damage</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +25% damage resistance while charging</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More than negates the health penalty while charging, and allows
the weapon to have stronger charges like it’s supposed to, while keeping
it weaker when you don’t have charge.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> 15% damage vulnerability → -30 max health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is equivalent to a 15% vulnerability at 200 health, or a
~17% vulnerability at 175 health. however, i prefer <a
href="#replace-damage-resvuln"><u>health</u> <u>changes over damage
vulnerabilities</u></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +25% charge on melee kills</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don't like this because I feel it doesn’t fit with the weapon.
Its main upside is making longer, stronger charges, not more frequent
ones – that’s the persian persuader’s purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the stat is somewhat extraneous because it’s not
impactful enough to make a real difference most of the time.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="soldier">Soldier</h1>
<p>Soldier has no class-wide problems and also boasts the most playstyle
variety out of the cast, so soldier’s in a pretty good spot, bar some
specific weapons.</p>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-2">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Note that <a href="#panic-attack"><u>some shotguns work
differently now</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> chaining rockets will deal 25% less self
damage (-65% total)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows for more aggression and mobility with rocket chaining
even without gunboats, opening up more variety for soldier secondaries
in comp.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> melees now mini crit while rocket
jumping</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> melee base damage: 65 → 85 (115 on
minicrit)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Soldiers often struggle to get offensive use out of melee (with
the exception of the market gardener), so this buff should allow more
playstyle variety, and make the damage penalties that the utility melees
employ actually mean something.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> can no longer equip the half-zatoichi</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon is pretty awkward on soldiers already, but the
universal buffs to both soldiers AND demo’s melee makes it especially
weird, as the same weapon would have to have different stats for both
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>i choose to remove it, and replace it with the <a
href="#walking-stick"><u>walking stick</u></a> made specifically for
soldier</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="liberty-launcher">Liberty Launcher</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I made this into a combo weapon. I think this design is the best
fit, since the reduced damage will push you to use your secondary more
for additional damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> reduced self damage: 25% → 40% (20-35 →
16-27)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows this to serve as a diet gunboats more effectively, which
frees up the secondary slot for a shotgun to use as your main source of
damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +40% faster deploy and holster speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows this to combo better with a shotgun</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> knockback is no longer affected by damage
penalty</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows the liberty launcher to pop people up in the air the same
as stock despite the lower damage, making it a better combo
weapon</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +1 clip size</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The clip size bonus doesn't really fit with a combo centered
rocket launcher, as you'll be relying on it less in favor of your
secondary which means you won’t need as many rockets anyways.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 40% faster projectile speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>increased projectile speed also doesn't suit a combo rocket
launcher as you'll want to be within shotgun range of enemies anyways,
making this stat largely redundant.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cow-mangler-5000">Cow Mangler 5000</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p>Downsides are irrelevant in 6s currently. though if engineer was
more common in 6s, it would help to balance this thing out a little…
although honestly being able to disable sentries might honestly be
stronger than normal rockets in a coordinated environment. it needs a
new downside that’s always relevant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed mini critting when it would normally
deal full crits</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat rarely ever comes into play (especially with no random
crits), so I removed it to simplify the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 15% slower projectile speed (1100HU/s →
935HU/s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon needs a general downside so that it’s not a straight
upgrade when there’s not any engineers. A slower projectile speed is a
good fit, as the laser weapons typically have slow projectiles, and it
changes how you play in all situations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beggars-bazooka">Beggar’s Bazooka </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> base projectile deviation: 3° → 1°, it it
ramps up +1° for each additional rocket loaded</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon is already extremely punishing for sustained fire
because you have to reload after each shot, so kneecapping its airshot
and spam capability is overkill. I still think it’s good to keep
<em>some</em> random deviation even for single shots, because it’s
interesting, changes how you play, and is core to the weapon’s identity.
i just don’t think it should be <em>as</em> severe as it is
now.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed no ammo from dispensers while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is almost completely irrelevant, it’s trivial to just
switch weapons to get around it. removed for simplicity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="air-strike">Air Strike</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>banned in Highlander because it's apparently too good with the
base jumper. the <a href="#b.a.s.e-jumper"><u>reworked base
jumper</u></a> should make that a non issue, i don’t think the problem
is really with the air strike itself</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -10% base explosion radius</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The air strike, while pretty good, is usually a slight downgrade
to stock. This tiny buff will help tip the scales ever so slightly,
while also simplifying the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="righteous-bison">Righteous Bison</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I think the best role for this weapon is as a finisher for
enemies that are escaping, and are too far away to hit with rockets.
emphasis on the far <em>away</em> part – the shotguns are already a good
finisher for close range, so this needs to have a distinct
application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +100% projectile speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it <em>much</em> more reliable at catching out enemies
at longer ranges.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> rays deal damage 5 times per second instead
of 2 times</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The multi hit aspect of the weapon is very unique, and is well
suited to a long range finisher because it makes it more effective
against retreating enemies, so I'd like to double down on that.</p></li>
<li><p>This is effectively a 50% increase in damage when the increased
projectile speed is factored in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> now deals 16 damage per hit; no ramp up or
falloff</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s hard to determine exactly how much damage this’ll do without
actually playing with it, so this number might need to be tweaked. but
the intent is that i’d deal 32-48 to standing targets, 16-32 to people
running through it, and 64-80 to people retreating. if the person is
strafing and only gets clipped by it, that’ll shave off 1 or 2 hits and
reduce the damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mantreads">Mantreads</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>currently banned in highlander</p></li>
<li><p>i believe the reason these are banned is because there is (was?)
a bug where you could equip these with the gunboats at the same time,
and get the effects of both. but aside from that, they aren’t actually a
problem for comp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> negates all fall damage on wearer (stomp
damage unaffected)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This greatly helps trolldiers by making their mobility
<em>completely</em> free. it won’t exactly make the trolldier viable,
but it’s a big bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>It also gives the mantreads a lot more general applicability for
normal loadouts by reducing the damage taken from rocket jumping –
albeit not nearly as much as the gunboats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="battalions-backup">Battalion’s Backup</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This item needs some kind of nerf i think. it’s pretty broken in
casual – the effect is clearly the strongest of all the banners. It's
like a vaccinator bubble for your <em>entire</em> team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 35% damage resistance while active → 25%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is still very strong against spam, making this a great
choice for pushing through a choke like it was intended. However, 35%
resistance is too good I think, because it messes with a lot of damage
thresholds that would normally kill. specifically, quickscopes will now
oneshot light classes, and medics will still go down to 2 pipes or
direct rockets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed critical hit resistance while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#replace-damage-resvuln"><u>I don't agree with crit
resistance</u></a>, and it’s especially bad on this weapon because it
affects the entire team. this shouldn’t nerf the battalion’s too harshly
– it was never its main purpose. This just removes the more polarizing
aspect of it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="buff-banner">Buff Banner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +50% primary ammo on wearer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The buff banner isn’t bad, but it is generally considered the
weakest banner. This new buff should give it the slight edge it needs to
compete with the other two, while fitting the theme of the item by
increasing your firepower.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shovel">Shovel</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-2"><u>soldier melees now deal a base
85 damage and mini crit while blast jumping</u></a>. i doubt most people
would drop any of the utility melees for this, but i feel this makes the
shovel at least serviceable, especially for beginners who don’t know
what they’re doing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disciplinary-action">Disciplinary Action</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p>In casual, this is fine, about as good as the escape plan. But
this thing is a big problem for competition because it allows a team to
get a fast heavy rollout at no cost, which is why it’s banned. there’s
other options to do this, but they have appropriate downsides. the GRU’s
health drain reduces the impact to balance it out, and teleporters have
a significant resource cost to build. the disciplinary action is
free.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟) whiplash</strong>: hitting this weapon (on an enemy or
an ally) reduces your max health by 25, down to a minimum of 100.
afterward, the max health is regained at 7mh/s (3.5s recovery per
swing).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This adds a cost to this weapon that limits its use. This still
can allow a heavy to quickly get to mid, but the soldier will be heavily
sabotaging themselves to compensate, which balances it out. This nerf
also doesn’t affect clutch escapes at low health, which I think is
good.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> does not mini crit while rocket jumping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintains this weapon's poor combat potential even with the
universal buffs to soldier’s melee.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equalizer">Equalizer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> the damage it deals is equal to your missing
health, or a minimum of 10 damage.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it situationally powerful. you could potentially do
199 damage in a single swing! However, it’s reigned in by the soldier's
lack of agility. running at someone to melee them when you’re at low
health is basically suicidal, which offsets the insane reward.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 40% slower swing speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You’re often below 120 health when you resort to melee anyways,
so the Equalizer’s upsides will come into play more often than
not.</p></li>
<li><p>This nerf is necessary to balance things out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="market-gardener">Market Gardener</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 20% slower swing speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it ever so slightly easier to market garden
people.</p></li>
<li><p>In the base game, this stat is basically meaningless in
comparison to the stock shovel for regular self defense – the nerfs
below accomplish that much better.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> damage: 85 → 70 (-15)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gives the market gardener a meaningful weakness compared to
stock. However, this is still a buff compared to the vanilla game. I
think one shooting other soldiers is a nice buff that the market
gardener could use, and it also makes trolldier duels more exciting
because both players can definitively one shot each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I know sometimes the other trolldier will die of fall damage
after getting hit, but that’s kind of lame… why doesn’t it just
kill!?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -30 damage on each successive hit until
holstered (10 minimum damage)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes it a bigger commitment to go for a market garden, and makes
it appropriately terrible for general use compared to stock.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="walking-stick">★ Walking Stick</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(todo – probably not worth it, speed boost is weird) A new sword
style weapon for soldier, intended to replace the half-zatoichi which is
no longer equipable. It's a cane sword that initially looks like an
ordinary walking stick before it’s unsheathed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> this weapon has a longer melee range</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> gain a 10% speed boost while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon is intended to be the best option in a soldier's
melee arsenal for longer melee fights, in contrast to the others which
are more suited to finishing off weakened enemies in a single
hit.</p></li>
<li><p>Both of these attributes help with this – the longer melee range
gives you a big advantage in melee fights, and the small speed bonus
increases soldier’s mobility slightly without the need to take out a
rocket launcher.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 100% longer deploy and holster time</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For all of the bonuses, taking this weapon out is a big
commitment. This gives the weapon a distinct approach compared to the
other melees. you can’t whip it out to finish someone off – you have to
make more careful judgements on when it’s worth it to use, and you’ll be
rewarded with a much stronger weapon for doing so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> does not mini crit while rocket jumping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon isn’t intended for burst damage, so a contradictory
bonus like this has no place being on the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scout">Scout</h1>
<p>Scout has a lot of unbalanced weapons (the most weapons banned in
competitive!), but the core of the class is all good. No changes.</p>
<h2 id="baby-faces-blaster">Baby Face’s Blaster</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>From what I can tell, the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lfYpc5vxXA"><u>boost</u>
<u>allowing the scout</u> <u>to outrun his own hitbox is a myth</u></a>
(it doesn’t make much sense in the first place, how are rocket jumping
soldiers not escaping their hitbox?)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 200% more damage needed to fully decay boost
(25 → 75)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current amount is way too low, with even the smallest chip
damage depleting the meter to 0. it’s not really possible to dodge
<em>all</em> damage, so i don’t think this is fair. 75 damage is more
reasonable, while still being low enough so that any strong direct hit
fully drains it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -10% base speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon’s entire purpose is horizontal mobility. this
shouldn’t be a situational upside – this weapon already nerfs every
other aspect of scout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> cannot double jump while active, but double
jumping after switching to a different weapon won’t drain boost</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i think a scout with ultra high horizontal speed <em>and</em> a
double jump would be really annoying to fight, so i agree with the
decision valve made to limit double jumping.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the current iteration has a big problem in that you can
sometimes accidentally double jump and lose your boost when you are
trying to slide off a ramp or whatever. This new system avoids that
issue. it does allow double jumping for free when out of combat, but i
think that’s fine.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-shortstop">The Shortstop</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 40% faster reload (1.52s → 0.912s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The shortstop is really not all that bad in my opinion, but it’s
still clearly worse than stock. This is just a general buff that gives
it a little something for everyone while playing to its strength in
sustained combat.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed shove</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The shove is useless in its current form, and I can't think of a
way to make it good such that it stays true to the shortstop’s design.
The specialty of the shortstop is being able to do better damage from
longer range over more sustained periods, but the shove encourages you
to do the exact opposite by getting in melee range (or, it would if it
wasn’t useless). it’s antithetical to the shortstop’s design, so has no
place being on the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-back-scatter">The Back Scatter</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> damage per pellet: 6 → 7</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This brings the maximum damage per shot up to 123, or 164 with
the mini crit. so the back scatter can now one shot medics, as well as
light classes from slightly longer ranges.</p></li>
<li><p>increasing the damage makes the mini crits from behind more
worthwhile, encouraging you to use this for its intended
purpose.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -20% accuracy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon’s reduced clip encourages you to be more precise
since you have fewer shots, but the accuracy penalty clashes with that
idea which I don't think is good.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 30% slower firing speed: 0.625s → 0.813s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes the weapon worse for direct, sustained combat, while not
affecting ambush situations much. A downside like this suits the weapon
well.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="soda-popper">Soda Popper</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -10% damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The soda popper is probably the best scattergun. it boasts higher
burst damage <em>and</em> dps compared to stock, on top of the hype
mechanic which is incredibly powerful in its own right, and why it’s
banned in competitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Many people do prefer stock because they don’t like the two shot
firing pattern. This is valid for sure, but it’s also entirely
subjective and doesn’t change the fact that the soda popper is
statistically better in almost every situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving it a 10% damage penalty is relatively minor – it
definitely won’t kill the weapon. but it’ll reign it in slightly,
similar to the other double shot scattergun, the
force-a-nature.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="force-a-nature">Force-A-Nature</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No direct changes, this is a cool weapon. However, it’s been
indirectly nerfed as the <a href="#remove-stuns-slows"><u>knockback on
enemies will now no longer stun them</u></a>, meaning that they can air
strafe during it. I don't see this really changing its power much, it
just makes it less annoying.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pretty-boys-pocket-pistol">Pretty Boy’s Pocket Pistol</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> clip size: 9 → 5</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently, this is <em>about</em> the same as stock in terms of
damage due to the faster firing speed, and yet it has its extremely
useful healing utility on top of that. but i don’t think it’s really the
healing that’s the issue, just the fact that it effectively has no
downsides because the damage is comparable to stock.</p></li>
<li><p>You could argue that having 3 less bullets makes it weaker
because it’ll deal less damage over time even with the faster firing
speed, and that’s true. However, the superior burst damage that the
firing speed grants is more important than damage over time on a
finisher like the pistol. Therefore, it’s necessary to make this clip
reduction much more harsh to truly make it a meaningful downside in
terms of damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flying-guillotine">Flying Guillotine</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +25 damage (50 → 75)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> mini crits blast jumping opponents (101
damage)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed bleed (effectively -40
damage)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> ~100% longer cooldown time (5.1s → 10s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The main thing that makes this thing so strong is that you're
able to deal so much damage from a distance at little cost.</p></li>
<li><p>You could argue that the wrap assassin does basically the same
thing, but the cooldown is much longer. This prevents it from being
spammed because if you just throw it out around a corner and miss, you
won’t have it for when you’re actually fighting someone. there’s a
meaningful cost to it. compare this to the guillotine, which recharges
so fast you can sometimes use it <em>twice</em> in a single
fight.</p></li>
<li><p>These changes aim to make it less spammy by nerfing the cooldown
and chip damage, but increasing the burst damage to compensate.</p></li>
<li><p>I choose to give it more burst but less overall damage as it
makes it more distinct from the wrap assassin, and also makes it less
effective for spam.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mad-milk">Mad Milk</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently banned in 6s and highlander</p></li>
<li><p>Banned in comp for a similar reason to the jarate: you can soak
an entire team in it and basically win the mid fight on the spot. beyond
that, it’s also really good in 1v1s since it’s so easy to hit, though it
does have a cooldown.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not a huge problem in casual because most scouts use it very
selfishly, such as to extinguish themselves, or to splash a single enemy
that they’re fighting. where this thing’s strength truly lies is in
teamfights, but most casual players don’t have that team support in
mind, so it’s a rarity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> recharge time: 20s → 35s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> mad milk does not start charged, and does not
refill from the resupply cabinet</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An effect so strong shouldn’t be this spammable. This stat forces
you to be more deliberate about when you use it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 50% smaller slash radius (200hu → 100hu,
about the same as a rocket)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mad milk’s vanilla splash radius is almost twice as big as a
rocket's (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYZbyUK170"><u>visualization</u></a>).
there's no skill in that, and it makes it trivial<strong>*</strong> to
hit someone with it, and impossible to really dodge. something this
impactful should not be so easy to pull off, hence the nerf. this also
limits mad milk’s capacity to soak an entire team in 6s and basically
win the mid fight on the spot, which is why it's currently banned</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>*)</strong> sometimes, mad milk will just decide to not
hit people. I'm not entirely sure why. It might be because <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxRzQeaxlA"><u>splash damage in
TF2 can’t curve around slopes or edges</u></a>, so if it’s on an uneven
surface it won’t work properly. i suspect this is why many people don’t
realize how massive the splash radius is, they often just assume they
missed when this happens. obviously this is dumb, and i’m making these
changes under the assumption that this would be fixed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonk-atomic-punch">Bonk Atomic Punch</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>banned in 6s because it allows you to get to a flanking position
to go for the medic for free. The enemy team can’t counter this unless
they send 2-3 people to go on a witch hunt for 1 scout while their
frontline collapses. but in casual situations where individual picks
aren’t so important and there’s lots of sentries, it’s not a problem,
though it is a little bad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> consumption time: 1.2s → 0.6s (50%
faster)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The lack of invulnerability really hurts the bonk’s escape
utility, so making it faster to drink should alleviate that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +66% movement speed while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it better for maneuvering into a flanking position,
helping to compensate for the removal of invulnerability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> cannot be targeted by sentries while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows bonk to retain the ability to bypass sentries despite the
lack of invulnerability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> no longer grants invulnerability while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think allowing people to damage the scout is necessary
counterplay for competition, though the other two stats will make that
very difficult so that bonk keeps its usefulness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crit-a-cola">Crit-A-Cola</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in 6s and Highlander because it makes it too easy to sac
for the medic, but it’s a solid concept.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> consumption time: 1.2s → 0.6s (50%
faster)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t think this will change much of anything for the crit a
cola, but i’d like to keep the time consistent with the reworked
bonk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> now marked for death for the entire duration,
instead of +5 seconds after each shot</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it harder to sac for the medic since you’ll be marked
for death before you even start shooting. it also just makes the
downside a lot more intuitive, because the marked for death and mini
crits durations are now synced.</p></li>
<li><p>This technically isn’t an objective nerf, because before you
could be marked for death even after the mini crits wear off. However,
that usually only happens after you’ve killed everyone or died trying,
so for all practical purposes, this is a definite downgrade.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bat">Bat</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No direct changes. Due to the <a
href="#universal-melee-buff"><u>universal melee buff</u></a>, scout’s
melee actually becomes pretty strong because it can quickly do the 3 hit
crit combo for a total of 175 damage, though it’s very risky. I think
this is enough to give the stock melee some value.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sandman">Sandman</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#remove-stuns-slows"><u>nothing can inflict slowing
anymore</u></a>, so this weapon needs an entirely new design.</p></li>
<li><p>I've seen some suggestions that the ball should be marked for
death (like the MvM upgrade), but I personally think that would be
extremely overpowered in comp. When things are that coordinated, being
marked for death means you'll get focused on by the entire enemy team
and probably die. you could use it to go for med picks while being very
safe, which i think would probably make it banworthy. Furthermore, I
think that concept is a little too similar to the fan o’war.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead, I went with a new design that gives speed to the user,
sort of an inversion of its current design. I think this fits the
weapon’s baseball theme.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -15 max health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon’s design already brings so much risk to the user, so
a health penalty on top of that is overkill. I prefer an offensive
penalty (the slower swing speed).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> on hit: gain a 3s speed boost</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> on miss: slowed for 3s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both of these apply when using the melee as well, not just the
projectile ball.</p></li>
<li><p>this reward for hitting the ball to be strong and distinct from
the wrap assassin, while still having it be balanced by adding a heavy
punishment for missing</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 80% slower swing speed (0.5s → 0.9s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it much harder to get the 3 hit crit combo,
encouraging you to use this weapon for its utility rather than damage,
making it unique from stock.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sun-on-a-stick">Sun-On-A-Stick</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(Mostly) ripped from the <a
href="https://badweaponrehab.tf"><u>bad weapon rehab</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> <strong>overheat:</strong> build by dealing
300 damage (from any weapon). activating with alt fire will cause the
scout to emit flames (like the vanilla huo long heater) around them for
8 seconds – which deals 15 damage per tick + full afterburn</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allows scout to inflict afterburn so that this weapon’s main
upside can be utilized more consistently.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed damage penalty (27 → 35, on crit: 81
→ 105)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> swing speed: -40% (0.5 → 0.7)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Replacing the damage penalty with a swing speed nerf makes the
crits more impactful (higher burst damage) while maintaining a similar
dps. i think this is warranted given the high cost (building
heat)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> this weapon won’t crit on the 3rd hit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensures this weapon is worse for direct combat against non
burning targets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="candy-cane">Candy Cane</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> instead of dropping a small health pack,
kills now drop a mint that heals 35% of max health (instead of 20%) and
can overheal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This also affects the small health pack that’s dropped on
death</p></li>
<li><p>Makes the upside more worthwhile to make up for the harsh
penalty. However, this is a bit of a double edged sword because it’s
also really bad if enemies pick it up, which makes the weapon more
interesting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> 40% explosive vulnerability → -25 max
health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I believe these are roughly equivalent (vanilla version has 75
effective health against explosives, but 125 against everything else).
However, <a href="#replace-damage-resvuln"><u>I prefer</u> <u>health
changes</u></a> which is why i went with this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomizer">Atomizer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -15% damage to players</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> this weapon doesn’t crit on the 3rd
consecutive hit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-15% damage doesn’t really affect anything, it’s a difference of
5 damage per swing (or 30 damage for the 3 hit combo) so it isn’t
needed. I think this weapon definitely <em>should</em> be worse for
combat though, so this new stat should do that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed mini crits while airborne</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is too insignificant to matter, so it’s better to just
remove it.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, it already has a very strong upside with the triple
jump, so reduced combat potential should be a more unambiguous
weakness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sniper">Sniper</h1>
<p>Ah yes, that class everyone hates. I think most of the criticism i’ve
seen towards sniper is very exaggerated and misdirected, so i feel it’s
necessary to clarify what i think <em>aren’t</em> problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Sniper is not overpowered</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being able to do such high damage quickly and safely from a
distance is no doubt powerful (as is being able to turn invisible, or
have instantaneous cross the map mobility). But sniper is highly
dependent on team support, is very difficult to play (*cough cough,
except bodyshots), and is countered by spam, mobility, and
coordination.</p></li>
<li><p>Just because a sniper can hypothetically instantly kill 5/9
classes with inhuman levels of reactions, execution, and awareness
doesn’t make the class overpowered. Pretty much every method to
determine balance you’ll find will look something like (power÷skill) …so
if you remove the skill from the equation for the sake of argument,
<em>of course</em> it’s going to look broken.</p></li>
<li><p>If a sniper is single handedly mowing down your entire team, it’s
because they’re a lunatic with hundreds, if not thousands of hours of
practice and therefore deserve to get rewarded (or they’re using
lmaobox). Any class can become an undefeatable final boss with a skilled
enough player, and sniper is no different.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you still doubt this, consider that even in 6v6 leagues, which
is comprised of the very best players to ever touch the game, almost no
one is running sniper, especially not full time. Many people argue that
sniper is only overpowered <em>now</em> because people have gotten
better than what valve ever intended, but that argument doesn’t hold
much water in my opinion. The other classes have gotten better
too.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sniper’s long range presence isn’t inherently unfair /
unfun</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I actually kind of agree with this, but I don't think the
<em>range</em> is the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting a sniper at long range is fine for the same reason that
fighting a sentry as a pyro is fine. because you usually always know
where a sentry is, it’s possible to avoid it and exploit limited range.
The pyro is at a clear disadvantage, but there’s still counterplay.
Likewise, if you have enough information to at least get a rough idea of
where a sniper is, you can avoid their sightline and play around them
even if you’re at a disadvantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is why my changes focus on information rather than sniper’s
raw power.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quickscoping doesn’t invalidate sniper’s close range
weakness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's <em>very</em> unreliable and difficult (especially with
flinching). I sometimes see people say things like “all it takes is one
shot for a scout’s flank to be ruined,” as if that’s not one of the
hardest and least consistent things in the entire game. I think <a
href="https://youtu.be/C7Rm5NhTm-k?t=657"><u>fsoas</u></a> put it pretty
well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you doubt this, look at any <em>unedited</em> footage of a
sniper, Highlander or casual, and count how many of their kills are
actually quickscopes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The only counter to sniper <em>isn’t</em> another
sniper</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obviously it can be one of the better ones depending on the
situation, but the idea that a sniper is untouchable by any other class
simply isn’t true. here’s a list of some effective counters:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strafing, double jumping, jumping with rockets, stickies, or even
the detonator makes you much harder to headshot, even for the best
snipers. If the sniper’s aim is exceptionally good, your movement will
have to match that – getting good at avoiding damage with chaining
rockets and unpredictable movement is a core part of the game. It should
be expected that it requires 100s of hours of movement practice to
counter a sniper with 100s of hours of aim practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>But what if there’s like, 5 people and a sentry watching
the sniper?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yeah, good luck getting past that on your own. But that scenario
isn’t indicative of a sniper being overpowered, it’s the <em>entire</em>
enemy team that’s stomping yours to protect their sniper and prevent
your team from getting an uber push.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Flanking and sightline avoidance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most snipers stand in the same spots and watch the same angles
every round and are thus very predictable. They are also highly
susceptible to tunnel vision when scoped in. traveling through
alternative routes to get to the sniper will therefore give you the
upper hand.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>But what if there’s no good flank routes, or the map has
super long sightlines?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>That's indicative of the map sucking rather than a problem with
snipers. Maps should aim to support TF2’s gameplay, not the other way
around.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Spam and harassment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sniper is a light class with no movement options and is
vulnerable to flinching. if you’re at mid range, a sniper can be spammed
out.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if your only option is to hit them for 3 damage across the
map, the offset to their aim will help you evade their
crosshair.</p></li>
<li><p>Weapons with damage over time like flare guns, the wrap assassin,
or the guillotine are especially effective as they essentially put the
sniper out of commission for a few seconds.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Overheal and coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are <em>certain</em> you’re going to get instantly
headshot the moment you turn the corner, then make sure you get a buff
from your medic before going in.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also try to go in with multiple people to push through to
the sniper since they are limited to picking off singular targets,
though that’s not always possible in casual</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in a <em>very</em> coordinated environment like
competitive, comms can greatly undermine a sniper’s influence. it’s a
lot easier to avoid getting headshot if your team is calling where the
sniper is looking.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>But what if my team sucks and can’t do that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>That means your team sucks, not that the sniper is an unbeatable
obstacle.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I don't think the criticism the sniper has received is totally
unwarranted. here’s what i believe are the <em>actual</em> problems with
sniper:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>A lack of counterplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While any class can single handedly dominate a server, a sniper
often feels a lot more oppressive than a soldier or scout of similar
caliber. but as i’ve covered, sniper isn’t really more powerful. This
problem stems from the sniper's lack of counterplay.</p></li>
<li><p>The main way you can play around a sniper’s sightline is to stay
out of it, but this is a pretty flawed interaction. It's usually
difficult or impossible to tell where the sniper is looking, so you have
to play a guessing game of which corridor you go down, leaving you no
agency in the situation. I think valve realized this, and attempted to
solve it by adding the dot, but it doesn’t really work because the dot
is <em>tiny</em> and isn’t visible at all if there’s not a wall
nearby.</p></li>
<li><p>The sniper might not be overpowered, but I think he is unfair in
many situations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>A lack of feedback for the opponent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There's nothing wrong with instant kill hitscan from a balance
perspective, but there’s no denying it feels kind of bad to play against
as it is currently. even if you dodge a shot, you can’t really tell if
it’s because of your movement or if the sniper just straight up missed.
The reward for dodging a sniper’s shot is very intangible, which is why
many people falsely believe it to be useless.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Body shots are too strong</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I elaborate more on this in the class changes below, but in
short, the high execution barrier sniper is balanced around mostly goes
out the window when the area you need to hit gets way, way
larger.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +20% headshot damage (150-450 → 180-540)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the changes below, scoping in has a higher execution barrier
and risk (laser sight reveals your location), so it seems fair that
headshots should have a greater impact. being able to one shot demos and
pyros, while still not being able to one shot overhealed light classes
seems fair.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> rifles will mini crit on unscoped headshots
(81 damage)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives the sniper slightly increased self defense, allowing
them to play more actively.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think this will undermine the SMG. For one, consistently
hitting even unscoped headshots isn’t the easiest, so the SMG is usually
better at finishing off low health targets. and even if you can always
headshot, the SMG still allows you to deal extra damage between sniper
shots during the passive reload, improving your self defense as
intended.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 0.2s delay on headshots after scoping
in</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this really doesn’t change <em>much</em>. hitting a headshot in
this window requires that you predict exactly where the enemies head
will be before you even start scoping in, which almost never
happens.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm of the opinion that quickscoping is balanced, and I think
allowing insanely skilled snipers to quickscope slightly faster on
targets that are moving predictably won’t tip the scales too much.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Again, if you doubt this, look at unedited footage of a sniper
and count the quickscopes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> rifles have a laser sight (like MvM snipers)
when scoped in</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehlrUPrvFuk"><u>This</u>
<u>video</u></a> gives you an idea of what this would be like.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although that experiment has the sniper’s vision <em>always</em>
visible which I think is really unfair to the sniper, it should
definitely be only when scoped in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>allowing enemies to see where a sniper is watching makes the
interaction more interesting for both sides. enemies have a chance to
avoid the sniper's sight completely, so if they choose to engage and
die, they still feel like they could have avoided it (similar to a
sentry).</p></li>
<li><p>The sniper also has more options to get around this weakness.
They can go for quickscopes, or try to hide their laser on a nearby wall
to bait people into thinking they are safe.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -20% body shot damage (50-150 → 40-120) (50 →
40 unscoped)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reason why being able to one shot enemies at long range is
balanced by the difficulty of hitting headshots.</p></li>
<li><p>Body shots take away most of the execution requirement, and the
charge time isn't a great enough cost. at long range you’ll be safe from
most classes anyways. For this reason, body shots deserve to be heavily
nerfed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="machina">Machina</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in 6s and Highlander because it makes it too easy to
bodyshot the medic.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +50% faster charge rate (full charge time:
3.3s → 1.6s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this keeps with the theme of a charge centered sniper rifle,
while not being annoying since you have to hit headshots to get much
benefit out of it (<a href="#class-wide-changes-3"><u>bodyshots deal 120
max</u></a>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> shots always penetrate players, not just
while fully charged</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> pierces through buildings, just like it does
with players</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The penetration ability is really cool, but it’s so situational
that it rarely ever comes into play. making it more versatile should
allow you to get more use out of it, changing how you play compared to
stock.</p></li>
<li><p>you could even use it to shut down engineers who are hiding
behind their sentry tanking it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> marked for death while scoping in</p>
<ul>
<li><p>with the machina being a charged centered rifle, it makes sense
to me that you should be encouraged to stay on the backlines. This stat
makes machina snipers highly vulnerable when caught out while in scope,
and quickscoping becomes a bit more risky.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +15% damage on full charge</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes the machina really good for bodyshots (the upside is
useless for headshots since a fully charged headshot will kill anyways),
which I'd like to discourage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sydney-sleeper">Sydney Sleeper</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>it’s banned in 6s because the faster charge makes it too easy to
drop the medic with a bodyshot</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> headshots crit instead of minicrit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i think having a rifle that can’t headshot is bad in concept. The
only way it can be viable at all is to have a strong benefit for hitting
bodyshots (which they don’t currently), but if bodyshots are powerful,
this rifle becomes way too easy to use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> jarate duration: 2-5s → 4-12s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The jarate effect is currently too short to get much use out of.
It's the most interesting attribute of the weapon, and yet it’s
currently overshadowed by the increased charge rate. This fixes
that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> shooting teammates will extinguish them
(shots still pierce teammates)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is apparently a loading tip, but it doesn’t actually happen
in game. i don’t see it being super useful, but it’s a fun extra
utility</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> base damage: 50 → 35</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This means quickscopes deal 126 damage. Being able to quickscope
light classes is vital, but requiring charge to oneshot demos, pyros,
and especially medics is a big downside that balances out the jarate
effect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 25% faster charge rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes a lot of sense for a bodyshot centered rifle, but I'd
prefer to avoid that. with this new design, it’s unnecessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> jarate is now only applied on headshots</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don't want this to be a bodyshot centered rifle (see
above).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bazaar-bargain">Bazaar Bargain</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 50% slower base charge rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Replaced with reload nerf below</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> heads now increase base damage (+5 per head),
instead of charge rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows you to quickscope soldiers after 2 heads, and deal a
252 damage quickscope with 4 heads – or a 114 damage unscoped mini crit
headshot.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel faster charge should be unique to the machina, since it’s
the charge focused rifle. increasing damage is unique to the bazaar
bargain.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> reload time: 1.5s → 2.25s (+50%)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Snowballing weapons should still have a relevant downside even
once snowballed. I chose reload time because it makes it even harder to
deal with multiple enemies which seems appropriate for a high damaging
weapon that’s ideal against single high health targets</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hitmans-heatmaker">Hitman’s Heatmaker</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> gain infinite ammo while in focus</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows focus to still be useful with the new
downside</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -20% damage on bodyshots</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-3"><u>This stat now applies to every
rifle</u></a>. The main reason this is impactful is because it prevents
fully charged body shots from one shooting medics and light classes, so
stacking on an additional 20% reduction isn’t a meaningful downside.
replaced with the stat below.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> reserve ammo: 25 → 12</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This forces you to be more careful and conservative with your
shots, which lives up to the weapon’s name.</p></li>
<li><p>This downside is also unique among the other rifles.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-classic">The Classic</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The classic got a big indirect buff because <a
href="#class-wide-changes-3"><u>all rifles can not mini crit on unscoped
headshots</u></a>, allowing the classic to be able to put out
<em>passable</em> damage without a full charge. The downside is still
significant though – 81 damage quickscopes definitely don’t stack up to
180 damage ones – so I don't think this will erode the classic’s
weakness too much.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could argue that this feature should be removed from the
classic because it detracts from the weapon’s signature drawback, which
is part of what makes it unique and interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I think this is acceptable though, because it only moderately
reduces the drawback to be more reasonable – uncharged headshot damage
is still less than half of what the other rifles can do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-3"><u>all rifles also emit a laser
sight when scoped in</u></a>, but this only applies to the classic while
hardscoping, so it has a bit of a niche now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +30% movement speed while charging</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a pretty drastic buff, since this weapon spends so much
time charging. This doesn’t completely negate the weapon’s downside. you
are still very vulnerable, but it's more manageable (especially against
enemy snipers).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> can fire in the air</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a really strange downside given that it’s unlisted, and
it’s the only rifle that even has it.</p></li>
<li><p>This prevents you from being unable to fire if you get popped in
the air by rockets or airblast.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -10% damage on bodyshots</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With the <a href="#class-wide-changes-3"><u>universal -20% damage
on bodyshots</u></a>, this added 10% becomes redundant as it doesn’t
cross any damage thresholds</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="huntsmen">Huntsmen</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Definitely situational, but genuinely viable in my opinion. I
don't think it really needs a buff.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the laser sight on the rifles will really help to give
this a niche, and help it combat enemy rifle snipers that usually are a
struggle for the huntsmen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> headshot detection fix: if the arrow
<em>only</em> hits the bounding box, it will never apply headshot
damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can sometimes hit headshots that you really shouldn’t have.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4JHCk7RAm0"><u>This</u>
<u>video</u></a> shows some weird head shots, and <a

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cleaners-carbine">Cleaner’s Carbine</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> firing speed penalty: -25% (59.25dps) → -15%
(66.25dps)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cleaner is too weak to really use to defend himself even as a
last resort – even melee is often better. this should make it so it's a
viable self defense tool while still being distinctly weaker than
stock</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> crickey charges with 2 kills (or 4 assists)
instead of 100 damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it easier to build the crickey (generally), and it
fits the theme of the weapon better as you’re supposed to be “cleaning”
up already injured enemies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jarate">Jarate</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in both 6s and Highlander</p></li>
<li><p>I consider this to be <strong>one of the strongest items in the
entire game</strong>, as long as you use it to support your team instead
of just using it selfishly. i think it’s fair to compare this to the
buff banner, that item also gives mini crits for your team and that
takes <em>600</em> damage to charge. This is like if the buff banner
charged from resupply or after 20s – the utility is so far above almost
anything else in the game. granted, it will only affect the people you
splash with it, but given how common it is for players to group up in a
choke or on an objective, it’s not uncommon to splash 3-6
people.</p></li>
<li><p>And i want to stress how powerful mini crits are. If you splash
3+ people on the point, your team will basically win the guaranteed
teamfight, which is why it’s banned in the competition. In casual,
things aren’t so coordinated so it’s not <em>as</em> big an issue, but
it’s game breaking in competitive.</p></li>
<li><p>On top of that, it’s also generally a better tool for self
defense compared to the smg when paired with the bushwacka, largely
invalidating sniper’s close range weakness for trivial effort.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i believe <em>jarate</em> is the problem here, not the
bushwacka.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>All that said, the concept is good. it’s just way
overtuned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> instead of having a cooldown, jarate charges
after taking 125 damage (ignoring fall damage)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> jarate does not start charged, and does not
refill from the resupply cabinet</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To get jarate quickly, you have to be playing actively on the
frontlines, giving enemies a chance to kill you before you get it. This
is more inline with other team supporting items like the buff
banner.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 50% smaller splash radius</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jarate's vanilla splash radius is almost twice as big as a rocket
(<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYZbyUK170"><u>visualization</u></a>).
there's no skill in that, and it makes it trivial<strong>*</strong> to
hit someone with it, and impossible to really dodge. something this
impactful should not be so easy to pull off, hence this nerf. this also
limits the jarate's capacity to soak an entire team in 6s and basically
win the mid fight on the spot, which is why it's currently banned</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>*)</strong> sometimes, jarate will just spontaneously
evaporate. I'm not <em>entirely</em> sure why, but I suspect it’s
because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxRzQeaxlA"><u>splash
damage in</u> <u>TF2</u> <u>can’t curve around slopes or edges</u></a>,
so if it’s on an uneven surface it won’t work properly. i think this is
why many people don’t realize how massive the splash radius is, they
just assume they missed when this happens. Obviously this is dumb, and
I'm making these changes under the assumption that this would be
fixed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> you can soak yourself in jarate, unless
you’re using jarate to extinguish yourself</p>
<ul>
<li><p>adds a greater execution barrier and risk to using jarate
defensively. it'd actually be pretty difficult to hit someone at close
range without pissing yourself, which is a necessary cost for an item
that's so impactful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="razorback">Razorback</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> while crouching, gain +20% damage
resistance</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> while crouching, gain immunity to
flinching</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> while crouching, rifles cannot charge (and
the huntsmen can’t be drawn)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There should be an animation with the razorback coming up when
the sniper is crouched to indicate that the effect is active.</p></li>
<li><p>This actually changes how to play. you have to recognize when
it’s a good time to crouch and trade mobility for resistance. it’s also
a lot more versatile and useful even for good snipers, instead of just
being a crutch like the current upside.</p></li>
<li><p>20% resistance is significant enough to help against general
damage, but won’t save you from a <a href="#sniper"><u>180 damage sniper
headshot</u></a>, so it should be balanced.</p></li>
<li><p>Preventing charging while crouched forces the sniper to open
themselves up, at least for a bit, if they want to deal maximum damage
when watching an area. This forces decision making and is more
interesting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> no longer blocks a single backstab
attempt</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This isn’t always a hard counter to spies. it’s sometimes
possible to just gun down the sniper if there isn’t a sentry
nearby.</p></li>
<li><p>but for the <em>sniper</em>, it doesn’t change how they play at
all, which is the issue i have with it. for good snipers, it’s utterly
unnecessary. but for bad snipers, it means they get rewarded for paying
zero attention to their surroundings, which isn’t great.</p></li>
<li><p>An item that passively counters spies when you <em>aren’t
looking</em> is a bad in principle, since that’s the only time spy can
be effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="darwins-danger-shield">Darwin’s Danger Shield</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> taking fatal, <em>non critical</em> damage
will break the shield, allowing you to survive on 1 health and prevent
flinching. the shield can be repaired with ammo packs (2 fulls / 4
mediums / 8 smalls)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This encourages you to play more actively. headshots and
backstabs, the main things a backline sniper is susceptible to, will
still one shot you. you have to be near the frontlines to get much
benefit out of it.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s other secondaries that serve this role as well, but this
isn’t a weapon you have to actively use, so it’s appealing if you want
to rely solely on your aim with your primary (especially with the
flinching protection).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 50% fire resistance &amp; afterburn
resistance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm <a href="#universal-changes"><u>removing all resistances to

egregious as it essentially just shuts down an entire class.</p></li>

<h2 id="cozy-camper">Cozy Camper</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> health regen doesn’t scale up; it’s always
4hp/s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> every 12 seconds, a medium ammo box is
dropped near you</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These are more significant upsides that further reduce the need
to reposition when using this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> bonuses will not apply with the user has
taken damage in the past 8 seconds</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want the cozy camper to heavily push the user into a more
defensive playstyle, since you really want to avoid taking damage. This
suits the weapon’s intended use, and ensures it’s kept distinct from the
other backpacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 20% knockback resistance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This doesn’t really change anything. any amount of knockback is
going to completely mess up the precision aiming that sniper requires,
so a small reduction is useless. removed for simplicity.</p></li>

<h2 id="tribalmens-shiv">Tribalmen’s Shiv</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Indirect buff: <a href="#class-wide-changes-4"><u>spy cloak no

<li><p><strong>🠝) -</strong>50% damage only applies to bleeding
targets</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +2 seconds of bleed duration (6s, 48 damage →
8s, 64 damage)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the intended strategy with this is to hit someone <em>once</em>
to inflict the bleeding effect, and then switch to another weapon to
deal additional damage (compared to stock, where it’s better to just
keep swinging until someone dies)</p></li>
<li><p>i think this weapon’s design works in concept, the problem is
just that the extra bleed damage is too insignificant and situational to
ever really be worth it, especially when you factor in random
crits.</p></li>
<li><p>these buffs should fix that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> hitting a target that’s already bleeding
won’t reset the duration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you’re only supposed to be hitting enemies once with this, so you
shouldn’t be rewarded in any meaningful way for successive
hits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bushwacka">Bushwacka</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I didn't nerf this weapon much at all, if anything I'd say it’s
even better. this is because i believe <em>jarate</em> to be the
problematic part of the jarate bushwacka combo.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a melee on a light class with no movement options, the
bushwacka is very high risk, and mini crits usually are pretty uncommon
to come by so it’s quite situational. These pitfalls are what allows
guaranteed melee crits on a class that’s traditionally weak at close
range to be balanced.</p></li>
<li><p>The issue only arises when jarate allows the sniper to get mini
crits easily and consistently. when paired with <em>literally
anything</em> else, it’s never a problem. i think this is pretty
indicative of jarate being overpowered, not the bushwacka.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 20% damage vulnerability while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This has been replaced by the stat below, which punishes you more
appropriately for misusing jarate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> take crits when you'd normally take mini
crits while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes the <a href="#jarate"><u>jarate</u></a> bushwacka combo
carry a substantial risk, because you’ll instantly die if you
accidentally splash yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>beyond that, it also changes how you play. if you know your
opponent has the detonator, the crit-a-cola, the reserve shooter, ext,
you have to adapt and use alternative methods to defend
yourself</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shahansha">Shahansha</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> after taking 100 damage, this weapon will
mini crit on it’s next swing, or full crit after taking 200 damage.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This upside actually changes how you play, as you have to make
decisions on when and how to use the crit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> removed old ±20% damage based on health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is balanced, but doesn’t change how you play, so it’s
replaced with the new (similar) stats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 50% slower deploy speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a necessary limitation. it gives enemies some time to
react before you pull out a melee with a guaranteed crit.</p></li>
<li><p>It also makes the shahasha a lot weaker as a last resort option
without a stored crit, to balance it out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="spy">Spy</h1>
<p>Spy is a really creative class that doesn’t really have an equivalent
in any other game (except ඞ). however, spy is often considered the
weakest class out of the 9, which i believe is due to these issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Predictability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This class is sort of a bag of tricks, but once you have like… 50
hours in the game, you will have seen most of what a spy can do, and it
just becomes a matter of paying attention. For this reason, it’s
tremendously difficult to get a pick on an experienced player as a spy
if they are paying any attention at all (which they will be after you
stab them once).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Spy checking is too easy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>a defensive pyro basically prevents a spy from making any plays.
disguises aren’t very effective because you can just shoot all your
teammates when you know there’s a spy around to reveal them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited playstyle variety</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many of the spy's weapons don’t change how you play very much
(with exception). I'd say Spy is probably in the bottom 3 for
variety.</p></li>
<li><p>This is sort of tied in with problem #1. if spies had more
alternative loadouts and thus more ways to trick you, they’d be much
less predictable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-4">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +20% damage resistance while disguised</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This doesn't really affect actual combat sense; you'll just lose
your disguise. It just means that tanking damage to pretend you are
someone's teammate is more effective, adding more opportunity for
trickery which is what spy is all about.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> when disguised, you gain a set of decoy items
from your disguise that you can toggle to with reload, replacing your
actual weapon. decoy items can fire fake bullets/projectiles that deal
no damage, and can also fake scoping in, medibeams, airblasting, revving
up, ext. with your real weapons out, you’ll run at spy speed regardless
of disguise, but with the decoys, you’ll run at the speed of your
disguise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allows the spy to act much more convincingly, which helps trick
even experienced players. It also makes the slow disguises like heavy
and soldier much more useful since you don’t have to hamper your own
speed so harshly. It also allows switching the held weapon without
redisguising, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>i’m glad i’m not making this game because this would be a
nightmare to program lol</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> movement speed: 107% → 111%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think it’s important that a spy is faster than a medic's 107%
speed. if a spy sneaks behind a medic, they shouldn't be unable to catch
the medic and get the backstab just because the medic is running forward
totally unaware.</p></li>
<li><p>This also serves as a good general buff to cloak management,
which I'd say a spy would use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> spread recovery time: 1.25s → 1s (-20%)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This better matches the timing of the revolver reload
animation</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> revolver spread resets gradually instead of
only after 1 second</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes the spread a little less punishing, since it won’t
mess up your aim much if you fire 0.01 seconds before the spread
resets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> while holding the disguise kit, the spy can
click on any specific player, building, ammo box, or health kit to
disguise as it</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a fun way to give spy more ways to trick people. i don’t
think disguising as buildings or health packs would be particularly
effective when playing seriously, but it would be great fun in casual
mode.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 100% faster disguise speed (2s / 0.5s → 1s /
0.25s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allowing the spy to switch disguises quickly allows for more
trickery (now 0.25s for switching disguises), like running around a
corner, changing disguise, and switching direction to make yourself look
like a different person.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> meters (like mmmph and crickey) no longer
charge from disguised spies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This attribute makes it too easy to fill up the meter, especially
with the added damage resistance to disguises.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, having inconsistent ruling on whether items do or
don’t charge from disguise spies is over complicated and unnecessary in
my opinion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> invisible spies no longer make footstep
sounds</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is VERY rarely utilized, but if you’re an absolute lunatic,
you can crank up your volume and sometimes catch a spy this way. there’s
not really anything the spy can do to counter this, hence it’s
removal.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> halved debuff duration while cloaked →
debuffs won’t reveal the spy if they have less than ⅔ of their duration
remaining</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows you to escape easier after being hit with one of
these effects, which I think is fair since fire, jarate, mad milk, etc
can be difficult to avoid and usually guarantee death if you get hit by
them.</p></li>
<li><p>however, the effects won’t be shorter, they’ll just visually
disappear sooner. I don't think this will hurt too badly, but I don't
like how ineffective bleed weapons are against spies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 20% damage resistance while
cloaked</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cloak is meant for stealth, not taking damage. a spy caught
out while invisible <em>should</em> be vulnerable, so i prefer trading
this cloak resistance for the disguise resistance above.</p></li>
<li><p>I do like the reduced debuff duration on cloak though, as
cloaking away is basically the spy’s only option once they get hit with
one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> hitboxes change to match the disguise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes headshotting disguised spies more fair.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ambassador">Ambassador</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> headshot crits aren't affected by falloff,
and will always deal 102 damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This opens up the weapon to be better at longer range
assassinations which it is meant to do. mid range headshots are hard to
pull off, so i think they deserve to do more damage than they currently
do.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, having falloff on headshots doesn't fit with this
which is supposed to be able to quickly drop targets that are out of
backstab range.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> now mini crits (45 damage, no falloff) on
headshot past the 1200hu headshot range</p>
<ul>
<li><p>because the spy can appear from anywhere, i think the capability
to drop snipers in just 2 shots from across the map like it was pre nerf
was a bit much. Having mini crits seems like a decent compromise, as the
spy has to hit at least 3 shots to do the same trick.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> spread recovery and headshot cooldown: 0.6s →
1s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes this weapon’s spread recovery match the reload animation
and be consistent with the other revolvers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, this weapon already has a shorter spread recovery, and
I think that stacked with the universal spread buff would be a bit much
for a revolver that is supposed to be worse for sustained
combat.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enforcer">Enforcer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> <strong>sleight of hand:</strong> this weapon
will mini crit on the 2nd consecutive shot, and will crit on the 3rd
consecutive shot onward. however, missing or pausing for too long (0.8s)
will lose the crits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives the enforcer very impressive damage once you start
critting. but this is difficult to pull off, because it requires you to
be very consistent (missing at all will <em>really</em> cripple the
damage), and it takes time before the crits get rolling.</p></li>
<li><p>This is extremely effective against sentries because you’ll never
miss, and gives this weapon a niche as the best anti sentry
revolver.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-6"><u>sentries no longer have crit
resistance</u></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> pierces sapper armor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(sapper armor is a 33% resistance sentries have while their being
sapped)</p></li>
<li><p>takes the resistance piercing concept further, and reinforces the
weapons new niche as an anti sentry revolver.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> firing speed: -20% → -40%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a 20% slower firing speed really isn’t all that bad. with the
current enforcer, you can use it the same as stock and barely even
notice. This weapon needs a huge penalty like this to force you to make
use of its upsides.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +20% damage on disguise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was hesitant to remove this, given it’s the defining attribute
of the weapon, but I don't think this is a good weapon design. the
ambassador fulfills the same long range assasination roll in a better,
more interesting way, so the enforcer needs to go in a different
direction.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diamondback">Diamondback</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in both 6s and Highlander</p></li>
<li><p>this idea is stolen (partly) from one of my friends</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> always perfectly accurate</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> base damage: -15% → +50% (34 → 60)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes this weapon extremely powerful (can 2 shot light classes at
close range), but limited by it’s tiny clip</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> on backstab: gain 2 extra bullets in the clip
that can only be fired once (like overheal, but for your clip)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed stored crits on backstab and building
destruction</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there's a really oblivious engie on the other team, the spy
can get a ton of free crits off them and their buildings, basically
turning this situation upside into a guaranteed one.</p></li>
<li><p>having stored (zero fall off!) crits that you don’t need to hit a
headshot for are also way too strong of a reward. gaining some 60 damage
bullets is more reasonable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> clip size: 6 → 1</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a severe downside that, unlike the old diamondback’s 15%
damage penalty, would actually be detrimental enough to make it
unfavorable for normal use.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it’s not enough to make this completely worthless
without extra bullets because it can still deal better burst damage than
the other revolvers, and it’s more effective for picking off targets at
long range compared to stock.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deadringer">Deadringer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>there’s a bug where sometimes kill sounds won’t trigger on a
deadringer, which is a pretty big giveaway. <a
href="#gameplay-improvements"><u>this should definitely be
fixed</u></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> decloak is now the same volume as the stock
watch decloak</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This really helps the believability of feigning your death. The
current sound is so loud that enemies can still figure out you
deadringered even if you did everything right and initially tricked
them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 100% longer cloak duration (7s → 14s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This helps you fake your death by giving you more time to
escape.</p></li>
<li><p>It's especially necessary because of the removal of the speed
boost, as more cloak is needed to traverse the same distance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> the first 3 seconds of cloak are
<em>completely invisible</em>; particle effects from fire, the short
circuit, ext won’t be applied, and damage sounds will not play.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This reduces the chances to accidentally catch out a dead ringer
spy with lingering flames or rollers, and it also prevents pyros from
tracking the spy through their cloak due to the brief blinking from each
flame particle.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> now occupies the primary slot rather than the
watch slot</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The deadringer is interesting for its potential to feign your
death and genuinely deceive people, but in practice, that’s its least
useful application.</p></li>
<li><p>The deadringer’s <em>actual</em> purpose is to be a get out of
jail free card – the resistance and speed it grants heavily overshadows
its intended use case because it allows the spy to escape almost any
situation. This is far from ideal due to how it largely removes
counterplay from the equation, while also being very easy to
use.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it’s not as simple as just nerfing the damage resistance
and speed. lacking a standard cloak to get behind enemy lines is a
crippling downside; the dead ringer <em>needs</em> those attributes to
be viable – at least as a watch.</p></li>
<li><p>This is why moving it to the primary slot is so important.
Because it only has to compete with the revolvers rather than the invis
watch, the frustrating aspects of the deadringer can be safely removed
without completely killing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>🠟) 75% damage reduction on activation → always survive the hit on
at least 1 health</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed the 3 seconds of speed and 65% damage
resistance after activation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the current deadringer is almost impossible to catch out even if
you predict it. The speed and resistance it grants allows the spy to
escape almost any situation, which doesn’t leave much room for
counterplay.</p></li>
<li><p>These nerfs should allow the spy to actually be killable after
popping.</p></li>
<li><p>I do feel it’s necessary to guarantee that the spy survives the
initial activation hit though. It really helps to fake your death,
especially against things like snipers and sticky traps. it shouldn’t be
annoying due to how limited though, it’s only a single hit, and it
doesn’t actually reduce the damage taken.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 20 second recharge → recharges after 2 kills
(or 4 assists)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>with this change, the deadringer is almost impossible to spam.
you’ll only get to use it once or twice per life on average. This
limitation pushes you towards thinking carefully about when you pop to
actually make your death look plausible so as to get the most out of
each charge.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> does not recharge from the resupply cabinet
(still starts charged on spawn though)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think this is necessary to get you to prevent spam on the last
point where the spawn room is close to the frontlines.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

entails a lot less risk since you won’t be left on low health and don’t

a loud sound when created.</p></li>

<li><p>after the hologram dies, there’s a 25 second cooldown to create

</ul>
<h2 id="red-tape-recorder">Red Tape Recorder</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I hate to completely gut a weapon like this and replace it, but I
can't see the tape recorder ever being anything other than annoying or
bad. Its strength is that even if the engineer removes it, it’ll still
demolish their buildings – but that doesn’t really afford much
counterplay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -100% damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a really crippling downside that doesn’t particularly fit the
theme of the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> when a building is destroyed, you rewind,
warping back to when you sapped the sentry, and also resetting your
health and cloak.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a unique mechanic that really fits the weapon. it
completely changes how you play and how enemies respond to you. you
might try to go in for a revolver kill after you use this because you
know you’ll be warped back to safety.</p></li>
<li><p>enemies can also take advantage by waiting at the sapped building
to ambush you once you return, so its usefulness depends on the
situation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed building deleveling while sapping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's a cool idea, but in practice I don't think this works too
well. The stock sapper is a lot more exciting: you either completely
destroy the building or completely fail. Having this consultation
mechanic really only serves to annoy engineers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grapple-hook">★ Grapple Hook</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>a “new” secondary for spies.</p></li>
<li><p>functions the same as the one in mann power, except:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can’t use it while cloaked</p></li>
<li><p>grappling will undisguise you</p></li>
<li><p>it’s slower than in mannpower (equivalent to 100% speed instead
of 111%)</p></li>
<li><p>you can’t grapple while holding another weapon out. it’s in its
own slot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The sapper is still a must have in most casual games. However,
giving the spy a secondary that isn’t reliant on countering enemy
engineers would make the class a lot more versatile, especially in 6s
where engineers aren’t often run.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-eternal-reward">Your Eternal Reward</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 33% faster cloak drain</p>
<ul>
<li><p>completely crippling and unnecessary, and doesn’t really fit the
weapon. you’re <em>supposed</em> to rely on cloak to get your first stab
since you can’t disguise, you shouldn’t be punished for doing
so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed the ability to disguise with the
disguise kit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives the weapon a more unified vision. you are more obvious
when wandering the map, but become harder to detect after a backstab.
having the ability to disguise before a backstab, even if it’s extremely
limited, dilutes the core concept of the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connivers-kunai">Conniver’s Kunai</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This knife is annoying to play against because after the initial
stab, there’s little you can do to prevent the spy from escaping or
continuing to chain stab your teammates. Many have suggested limiting
the overheal to only 180, and while I think that would help somewhat, it
doesn’t address the root of the frustration.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, having only 70 max health is sometimes unfair, and
doesn’t change how you play much despite how harsh it is.</p></li>
<li><p>I hate to completely gut every stat of this weapon and basically
remove it from the game, but I don't think there’s any solutions to
these problems that stay in line with the knife’s existing design.
however, given that there’s already 2 other chainstab knives (the YEAR
and big earner), turning this third most egregious one into something
else is acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, you could argue that the <a href="#deadringer"><u>dead
ringer</u></a>’s damage resistance is the real problem, because it often
negates the kunai’s reduced max health. I definitely agree with this –
the dead ringer is a huge part of why the kunai is so despised – but all
the problems I listed above still apply. I still think at least
<em>part</em> of the problem is with the kunai itself.</p></li>
<li><p>To try and preserve some vein of the knife’s concept, I kept an
on backstab effect, and basically just switched the upsides and
downsides to affect cloak instead of health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> instantly cloak after a backstab</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This new upside fits the concept of getting a survivability bonus
after cloaking, but in a more fair way because you can’t chainstab
without uncloaking, and you can’t tank a ludicrous amount of damage.
you’ve invisible, but still vulnerable if the opponent can predict
you.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -55 max health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is certainly detrimental, but I still feel it doesn't
actually change how a spy plays in my opinion. you’re vulnerable when
caught out whether you have 125 health or 70.</p></li>
<li><p>I also feel it doesn’t leave enough counterplay for the spy – it
brings you into the threshold to get one shot at so many things that you
can’t reasonably react to. There's a reason why every light class has
1<em>2</em>5 health minimum.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 20% faster cloak drain rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a significant but manageable downside that plays off the
knife’s cloaking upside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed health stealing on backstab</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This doesn’t leave enough counterplay for enemies who pay
attention and notice the spy after they get a backstab.</p></li>
<li><p>it’s also overpowered in casual mode in my opinion, since it can
allow a spy to take 500+ damage if there’s enough oblivious players to
subsist off of. you need to be <em>good</em> to do this, but i still
think it’s pretty egregious.</p></li>
<li><p>there’s also the additional problem in that this is a snowballing
effect that leaves the kunai with <a href="#snowballing-drawbacks"><u>no
downsides once it’s snowballing</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>replaced with the new upside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="big-earner">Big Earner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +30% cloak on backstab → restore full
cloak</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The big earner’s extra cloak is pretty underwhelming, and I think
a full cloak regen would be more meaningful. especially with the new
downside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -25 health</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> cloak no longer replenishes passively</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this has the same problems as the kunai’s health penalty</p></li>
<li><p>-25 health, while impactful, doesn’t change how the spy plays.
Yes, you’re more vulnerable when caught out, but a spy is
<em>always</em> vulnerable when caught out (except kunai dead ringer),
having 100 health doesn’t really change that or push you towards a
unique way of playing. it’s balanced, but it’s not interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, I think it’s a bit unfair for the spy. Being at 100
health brings you down to threshold where you can be oneshot by rockets
and pipes before you can react which doesn’t leave the spy reasonable
counterplay. there’s a reason why every light class has a 125 health
minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>replacing the health penalty with a lack of cloak regen avoids
all those problems and actually changes how you play. harder to maintain
your cloak unless you’re being aggressive and actually living up to the
weapon’s name.</p></li>

<h1 id="pyro">Pyro</h1>
<p>I really admire Pyro's unique gameplay and combos, but I feel TF2’s
implementation of these ideas could be much better. in game currently,
pyro has a number of problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>General weakness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pyro is a pick / support hybrid, but really isn’t good enough at
either to ever be the <em>best</em> choice. Like anything, it can
certainly work in casual mode but it’s rarely optimal, and pyro doesn’t
have much use in comp beyond airblasting people off last.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Overly defensive playstyle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While not as bad as heavy in this respect, pyro’s current
airblast centric meta has the potential to slow the game down.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>you certainly <em>can</em> play pyro in a more offensive way, but
it’s not optimal and falls apart at higher levels of play.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Skill expression on pyro isn’t appropriately
rewarded</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you’re somewhat good, it’s often not worth it to go for a
difficult flare combo or axtinguisher finish or a reflect if you’re not
<em>certain</em> you can hit it, because just holding down the fire
button will do the same trick more consistently.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not saying those examples I listed <em>never</em> have value
compared to w+m1, they certainly do. but it’s not as much or as often as
I feel it should be.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-5">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The overarching theme you’ll notice is a shift towards making
pyro into a combo class, with reliance on the flamethrower being
discouraged. The reason for this is that both functions of pyros
primary, while interesting and fun, are annoying in excess.</p></li>
<li><p>there isn’t much depth to <em>just</em> flaming, so it shouldn’t
be pyro’s main source of damage. Air blast is pretty technical and fun,
but it’s also really annoying sometimes and has the potential to slow
the game down, so I opted to limit it. It's the best solution I can
think of to problems 2 and 3.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also completely overhaul the flame thrower into the
dragon’s fury, but that would be a hard pill to swallow for pyro mains
currently and I personally wouldn’t like it.</p></li>
<li><p>note that <a href="#afterburn-rework"><u>afterburn</u></a>, the
<a href="#panic-attack"><u>panic attack</u></a>, and the <a
href="#reserve-shooter"><u>reserve shooter</u></a> work differently
now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> pyro melees now drop a small health pack on
kill</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it’s usually not a great idea to use your melee as a finisher
since it entails a lot of risk for just to do what w+m1 could have
accomplished more consistently. i think this would remain the same even
with the +15 damage buff below. This buff is a way to make melee an
effective finisher and make the reward worth the risk without giving it
an absurd damage increase.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> melee damage: 65 → 80</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows pyro’s melee to have useful combat potential beyond
the axtinguisher.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> airblasting now pushes the pyro backwards
(~half of the detonator)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many have suggested that the pyro should have more mobility (like
speed buff to 107%). I think this is fair given pyro is so limited by
range. They need tools to close the distance if they are to work as a
pick class.</p></li>
<li><p>this buff does just that, but it’s more interesting than just a
flat speed boost because it’s a lot more deep. you have to actively
decide when using it will be worth the costs; it won’t help pyros w+m1
at people. there’s also more mechanical skill to learn in how to get the
optimal distance, or how to combine it with a detonator jump.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> flames no longer deal damage based on
‘density’ (since blue moon), instead always dealing the max ramp up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the damage <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqaI5LhNalk"><u>doesn't work
properly in game currently</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>Even if all those problems were fixed though, I don't think this
mechanic is really good for pyro’s combo oriented design because it
punishes you for switching weapons rather than continuing to apply
flames. This makes more sense with the concept of pyro in the base game,
but it’s out of place with this overhauled vision of the class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> the first flame particle emitted will travel
30% faster (and further), with a 0.1 second cooldown</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows you to ‘poke’ enemies from longer ranges to set them
up for a combo, or repeatedly tap the fire button to zone out certain
enemies. This added a little bit more depth while bolstering pyro’s
potential as a pick class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> flame particles now inherit the user’s
velocity directly, like pre jungle inferno</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This introduces more depth to flame manipulation, allowing you to
bend how they travel based on your movement, which can help with
axtinguisher combos or combos against fire resistant targets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> extinguishing teammates heals <em>the
teammate</em> 50% of the damage they took from afterburn, instead of
healing the pyro 20 health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Healing the teammate instead of the pyro is a lot more intuitive,
and also enhances pyro’s supportive capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>I think healing 50% of the afterburn damage rather than a flat 20
health is better because it means pyro can extinguish people much more
efficiently than a medic can, giving pyro a supportive niche.</p></li>
<li><p>It also adds some depth into extinguish priority (it’s better to
extinguish those who have been on fire for longer), which raises the
skill ceiling a little.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> <strong>overheat</strong>: flaming for too
long (20%/s, 5s total) will overheat the flamethrower and force a 3s
cooldown, during which you can’t flame or airblast. when not flaming,
the heat will dissipate at 13.3%/s (7.5s total). additionally,
airblasting will instantly reduce heat by 30% (1.5s).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there should be a visual indication of this, with the
flamethrower getting redder as it heats up or something</p></li>
<li><p>These changes punish pyros for relying solely on flames. w+m1
isn’t exactly overpowered, it’s <em>very</em> easily countered. However,
I'd say it’s pretty strong for how little skill it requires. it also
somewhat invalidates going for the more advanced techniques because just
using flames is so much more consistent, which isn’t ideal. For these
reasons, a limitation is warranted.</p></li>
<li><p>The overheating mechanic also limits pyro’s capacity to
<em>constantly</em> spy check the entire game, while still keeping
flames as a very powerful spy counter. This is good, because a paranoid
pyro that’s constantly spy checking is often impossible for a spy to
work around. The overheat mechanic ensures there’s windows of downtime
for a spy to strike, even if the pyro is extremely vigilant.</p></li>
<li><p>This also adds a ton of depth in managing your heat. For
example…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>tap firing to spy check as efficiently as possible</p></li>
<li><p>intentionally overheating to cool down faster than just letting
it dissipate</p></li>
<li><p>deciding when it is or isn’t worth it to airblast to cool
down</p></li>
<li><p>integrating airblast into your combos to help mitigate
heat</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> airblast cooldown <em>on miss</em>: 0.75s →
1.2s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The intent is to make airblast less spammable, without
diminishing the reward for restrained use of it. I feel this change is
necessary because it’s sometimes too easy to get airblasts just by
spamming, and because airblast has the potential to slow down games in
excess.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> airblast no longer reduces the air control of
enemies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The way in which airblast essentially locks your movement until
you hit the ground again doesn’t afford enough counterplay, so this nerf
is deemed necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>explosives like rockets can launch you upward in a similar way,
but the key difference is that rockets can be effectively surfed because
they don’t prevent air strafing. you have some options, which makes it
fair – that’s what airblast is missing right now.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> the airblast hitbox is slightly smaller, so
that you can’t airblast things directly behind or besides you. the box
should also rotate based on where you’re looking instead of having a
static orientation</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ0axNXvNik&amp;t=218s"><u>airblast
hitbox visualization</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>This makes airblast a bit more fair, but it doesn’t change
<em>much</em> in terms of the execution requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>i actually much prefer the cube hitbox to a cone, because it
makes reflect jumping much more consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>making the box rotate makes the distance at which projectiles can
be reflected consistent, compared to how it is right now where it’s
harder to reflect at certain angles.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backburner">Backburner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed airblast penalty</p>
<ul>
<li><p>replaced with ammo penalty.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> flames crit from behind → ignite damage will
crit from behind (90 damage)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>having increased burst damage rather than a constant stream of
crits is much better suited to an ambush playstyle.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the back detection can sometimes be janky and
annoying, because turning 90 degrees for a split second can cause you to
take a bunch of damage. having a single crit at the start (like the spy
knives and the backscatter) fixes this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> max ammo: 200 → 125</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes the backburner unsustainable in long fights, as an
ambush centered weapon should be. I prefer this to an airblast penalty
as it also affects all pyros, instead of harshly punishing pyros who try
to airblast.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phlogistinator">Phlogistinator</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>One thing that hasn't changed is the crits – I feel that with the
introduction of the overheat mechanic, the phlog already has a big
limitation slapped on it, so a further nerf isn’t really necessary. not
to mention it’s the most iconic part of the weapon, so changing it would
be quite contentious.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> no air blast → air blast replaced with
<strong>energy burst</strong> that can only <em>delete</em>
projectiles</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While much less useful than airblast, this at least allows phlog
pyros to defend themselves while they approach to get into flamethrower
range. This makes phlog pyros much less reliant on having a dedicated
pocket medic, and adds more skill expression.</p></li>
<li><p>The phlog taunt is now activated with reload.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> overheal drains 500% faster while active (15s
→ 3s for full drain)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>draining overheal means the pyro has to put themself at risk to
run at people with the guaranteed crits, which ensures there’s adequate
counterplay even if they have a dedicated pocket medic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="degreaser">Degreaser</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed -80% afterburn damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This looks bad, but in practice it’s kind of a nothing stat.
especially with the <a href="#afterburn-rework"><u>rework</u></a>,
you’re almost never going to finish someone off with afterburn, so this
damage penalty is pretty meaningless. replaced with the overheat penalty
that’s more impactful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed increased airblast cost (25 → 20)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat does also basically nothing, 8 airblasts instead of 10
almost never matters. removed for simplicity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> swapped deploy and holster speed. now: 60%
faster holster, 30% faster deploy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This means two things: it’s better for combo pyro, and it’s
slower to switch to the degreaser to airblast. I like this, because it
gives projectile classes windows of opportunity to safely attack when
the pyro pulls out their secondary, adding counterplay.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> this weapon overheats 50% faster: 5s → 2.5s
(cooling speed unaffected)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>see <a href="#class-wide-changes-5"><u>class wide
changes</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>This forces you to rely on your secondary more and utilize the
switch speed, which is what the weapon is clearly intended for.</p></li>
<li><p>it also really limits your spy checking, which i think is a
necessary downside. pyro is a combo class, so faster switch speed is
extremely valuable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dragons-fury">Dragon’s Fury</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> never overheats</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this maintaines the dragon’s fury’s focus on raw damage. all of
the rational for overheal on the other flamethrowers doesn’t apply to
the dragon’s fury.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gas-passer">Gas Passer</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>this weapon is only banned in Highlander because of an exploit
that lets you throw it through specific walls, so it’s considered
mechanically broken and therefore banworthy. It’s not actually
good.</p></li>
<li><p>This weapon’s concept as a supportive teamplay item, similar to
mad milk, doesn’t really work on pyro. unlike scout and sniper, pyro
lives and dies on the damage or utility from their secondary to be
effective in combat. without that, pyro is forced into a risk averse
play style that’s very boring and relatively weak.</p></li>
<li><p>This is why i choose to make the gas passer more of a combo
weapon for the pyro themself rather than a supportive team
tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Indirect buff: <a href="#neon-annihilator"><u>enemies hit by the
gas now count as wet</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> enemies soaked in gas take +100% ignition
damage (30 → 60)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#afterburn-rework"><u>see afterburn
rework</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>This allows the pyro to follow up on their own gas, unlocking
some interesting synergy. when combined with a backburner crit, it could
deal 180 damage which is pretty insane.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> charge rate: 750 damage / 60s → 100
damage</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> now starts charged on spawn (still doesn’t
refill from the resupply cabinet)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pyro is a lot more reliant on they’re secondary compared to other
classes, so making the gas have a high uptime is essential.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> enemies soaked in gas won’t be ignited from
non fire damage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat would be way too powerful now because of the 60 ignite
damage and the significantly faster charge.</p></li>
<li><p>This team support element makes a lot of sense for the gas
passer’s old design, but with the focus being shifted toward a combo
weapon, it’s not needed (see explanation at the top).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>🠟) -70% smaller base splash radius, but it enlarges to the
current radius if you hit an enemy directly with the gas can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>because of the faster charge, the gas passer is much more
spamable now which could get pretty annoying. The vanilla splash radius
would also make comboing with the neon annihilator too easy, so this
nerf is needed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> charge progress resets on death</p>
<ul>
<li><p>more of a formality. it’s so disposable now that it doesn’t
really matter, but it makes it consistent with other meter based
weapons.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scorch-shot">Scorch Shot</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes are heavily inspired by the bad weapon balance
mod</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> flares can bounce again if they hit an enemy
again on the way down</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows the scorch shot to potentially do some pretty serious
damage – but it’s situational. it’s only better if you hit directly
<em>and</em> the target(s) doesn’t move out of the way.</p></li>
<li><p>There's some new combo potential with airblast since you could
push enemies into your flare’s bounce, which I think would be really
flashy and fun.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed stun and knockback</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#remove-stuns-slows"><u>every stun effect has been
removed</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>the slowness that’s inflicted on hit completely removes you’re
ability to dodge the bouncing flare – or the pyro’s follow up attacks –
which is pretty egregious in terms of <a
href="#counterplay"><u>counterplay</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>The knockback is fine to play against, but it’s seldom ever
useful. with the new focus on the bouncing flare especially, it’s really
only going to mess up your combos more than anything.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> flares bounce up when first hitting a surface
instead of instantly exploding</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives the weapon a niche in area denial with ‘flare traps’
unlocking a very distinct playstyle from the detonator.</p></li>
<li><p>it also gives enemies the ability to actually dodge the splash.
giving what other weapons only deal minor chip damage for
<em>afterburn</em> is one of the biggest reasons this thing is so
effective when spammed.</p></li>
<li><p>The current scorch shot makes applying afterburn essentially
free, which is too strong and leaves little options for the enemy to
deal with it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thermal-thruster">Thermal Thruster</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed slower deploy and holster speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The slow switch speed makes the thermal thruster a lot more
situational than it needs to be. it already has a massive downside in
that you’re giving up a damaging secondary, which is a big deal for
pyro.</p></li>
<li><p>The sluggishness is also very clunky to work with, which really
detracts from the fun factor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> recharge time: 15s → 12s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>because pyro is such a combo centric class, secondaries need to
have a high uptime. The thermal thruster doesn’t struggle with that
<em>too</em> much, but I think it could stand to recharge a bit faster,
especially given how situational it is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +50% knockback taken while equipped now only
applies while flying</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes the downside something that can be worked around,
making it less annoying, while still giving enemies a way to prevent the
pyro from bombing in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> marked for death while flying</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think it’s necessary to give enemies some way to stuff a
bombing pyro, or prevent a pyro from easily escaping. Making the jump
have a slow delay is an okay way to do that – but it feels really clunky
and unsatisfying to play with. This upside doesn’t have that
problem.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mannmelter">Mannmelter</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> can now extinguish enemies to gain a crit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This keeps the upside situational, but no longer reliant on the
enemy team having a pyro. it also adds a lot of depth to the weapon,
since you’ll be rewarded greatly for extinguish setups.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 50% faster projectile speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is fairly useless since flares are already so fast and
only really serves to mess up your aim if you use the other flare guns.
removing this simplifies the weapon while not greatly affecting its
strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I feel this doesn’t really fit well; energy weapons
typically have slower projectiles.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detonator">Detonator</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed +50% self damage (knockback
unaffected)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For pyro to work as a pick class, this mobility from detonator
jumping is needed as a gap closer to compensate for pyro's limited
range. However, putting yourself down to ~140 health before you engage
is too punishing. It also makes detonator jumping mostly useless for
speeding up your rollout since the self damage just isn’t worth it most
of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Reducing the damage allows pyro to get more use out of this fun
mechanic, and also opens up more offensive potential for the
class.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the reason why knockback isn’t affected is because it’s
apparently calculated using the <em>base</em> damage – which really
makes me wonder why valve added this stat in the first place but…
whatever.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flare-gun">Flare Gun</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 50% faster deploy speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes flashy flare combos more effective. This gives pyro a niche
in that they can drop light classes faster with the degreaser than other
combat classes. I think this is warranted given how unforgiving the
flare gun is if you miss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fire-axe">Fire Axe</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>pyro's base melee damage is now
80, and they all grant a small health pack on kill</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>I feel these universal changes are enough to make stock at least
a serviceable option. The axtinguisher is a more damaging finisher, but
it’s slower and more risky, so I think stock still has some
advantages.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="axtinguisher">Axtinguisher</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>Pyro's base melee damage is now
80</u></a>, meaning this would be a mini crit for 108 (with the damage
penalty removed). i’d say this is fair, it puts it about on par with a
flare combo (a bit easier with a greater reward, but a lot more
risky)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> crits when hitting an enemy just as they’re
ignited</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm not sure how short the window should be – maybe
0.25s?</p></li>
<li><p>This legitimizes highly skillful and flashy combos that are
currently only relegated to <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sau-pmG7RI"><u>frag
montages</u></a>, making this an actually effective strategy. It's a
high risk though. pulling it off consistently is extremely difficult
(especially on good players), and you’re likely to get yourself going
for it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 33% damage penalty only applies to non
burning targets</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed bonus damage based on afterburn
duration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Having the damage based on afterburn duration is cool on paper.
but in actual gameplay, makes it difficult to precisely judge how much
damage it’ll do, and is needlessly complex. i prefer it to be just a
flat 108 damage.</p></li>
<li><p>There's also the problem where once you build up enough afterburn
where you’ll do significant damage with this, the enemy is probably
already close to dead, so it’s not needed against anything short of a
heavy (which you won’t be able to get in melee distance of anyways). I
think it’ll be much more effective as a burst damage option.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="sharpened-volcano-fragment">Sharpened Volcano Fragment</h2>

<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>Pyro's base melee damage is now

<li><p>makes this weapon a sort of a reverse axtinguisher, where you use
it to start your combo instead of to finish it. this would deal a total
of 118 damage (with the +30 added <a href="#afterburn-rework"><u>ignite

<li><p>this isn’t meant to be used as a finisher, so you shouldn’t be

situational to work as the main upside. admittedly this stat is also
quite situational, but not nearly to the same degree; there’s overhealed
players in basically every game. at the very least, this stat will give
this weapon a use beyond the 2fort sewers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> crits enemies soaked by the gas passer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it’s really unintuitive that this <em>doesn’t</em> happen, so
this is an obvious change to make. I doubt this combo would be
particularly effective in serious games, but it makes for a funny and
interesting strategy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> can no longer remove sappers</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don't like this, I think it just infringes on the main
specialty of the homewrecker.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -30% swing speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When combined with the 20% damage penalty, this weapon is
significantly worse when you aren’t utilizing its extremely powerful
upsides, balancing the weapon and forcing you to change how you
play.</p></li>

of 28. incredible…</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> speed boost duration: 1s → 6s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>speed on hit is a genuinely useful upside, it’s just so short
with the current version that it’s essentially useless.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homewrecker">Homewrecker</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>pyro melees now deal 80 base
damage</u></a>, so this would do 240 to buildings and 56 to
players.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +75% knockback resistance while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows the pyro to use this weapon against sentries a bit more
easily, and gives it some utility against heavies and knockback weapons,
while still keeping it pretty situational. The hiGPS balance mod also
does this same thing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +100% damage to buildings → crits buildings
(+200%)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-6"><u>buildings no longer have crit
resistance</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>Even with the knockback resistance, it’s still pretty hard to
close the distance on a sentry, so the upside will be difficult to
utilize unless you’re ubered.. for that reason, i think it’s fair to go
all in on the bonus and allow it to one shot buildings. that might allow
a pyro to compete with soldiers and demos in terms of sentry busting,
but only in specific situations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> sappers no longer count as buildings, meaning
they take two hits to destroy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I feel this weapon is too strong against spies. Pyro is already a
very effective spy counter, but at least a spy can usually wait for
moments where the pyro is distracted to go in for the sap. This weapon
negates a lot of that, since the pyro can instantly remove it.</p></li>
<li><p>This nerf makes it much tougher to remove the sapper in time,
which makes it more reasonable for a spy to actually take down a sentry
while a pybro is watching.</p></li>

<h2 id="back-scratcher">Back Scratcher</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>pyro melees now deal</u>
<u>80</u> <u>base damage</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> health packs can overheal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon has an interesting design, but its upsides aren’t
quite enough to be worth it in most situations. The powerjack also helps
roamer pyros arguably even more, without sandbagging their healing from
other sources. This buff should tip the scales in favor of the back
scratcher for roaming, as it essentially replaces the need for a
medic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> +20% damage (80 → 96) → +10 damage (80 →
90)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a 96 damage pyro melee would be a little ridiculous, since unlike
heavy, pyro is fast enough to close the distance on enemies pretty
effectively and has airblast to throw off enemy movement.</p></li>
<li><p>a nerf of 6 damage may not seem like a lot, but that’s enough to
prevent it from one shot mini critting light classes, and puts it just 2
damage above the current backscratcher, which hasn’t proven to be
problematic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="powerjack">Powerjack</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>pyro melees now deal 80 base
damage</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>it’s clearly the best option for the slot, but it’s also fun and
not game breaking or annoying to play against, so i don’t wanna nerf it
too harshly. Instead, I went with buffing up pyro’s other melees, which
also encourages combos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 20% damage vulnerability while active →
marked for death while active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the same downside, but harsher, and more visible to enemies. This
item is still very strong, but the pyro has to be more careful about
when they take it out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +25 health on kill</p>
<ul>
<li><p>25 health is too little to really make a difference in most
situations, so removing it just simplifies the weapon without nerfing it
too harshly.</p></li>
<li><p>it’s also been made even more redundant, because pyro melees give
a small health pack on kill anyways.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="engineer">Engineer</h1>
<p>engineer has two major problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Overly defensive focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is bad because it slows down games</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Too slow to adapt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>setting up buildings generally takes too long to keep up in
faster paced modes like 5cp, even when using the unlocks that are
specifically designed to do that as fast as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>maps where the spawns change frequently are especially bad for
engineers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-6">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> buildings can be hauled while they are
constructing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> building redeploy speed: 100% faster → 200%
faster</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both of these changes allow the engineer to play more creatively
and aggressively (less punishment for moving buildings), raising the
engie's skill ceiling and helping the class keep up in more dynamic game
modes that require more active playstyles. It makes engineering more
generally applicable without taking away from the specialties that make
the class unique.</p></li>
<li><p>you could also just increase the base construction speed or
something, but i think these changes are much more interesting and add
more depth.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> level 3 teleporter recharge: 3s → 0.5s</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The teleporter is often said to be engie’s most impactful
building, but honestly I think their strength is kind of
overblown.</p></li>
<li><p>if a bunch of people die at once, they can’t all reenter the
fight <em>together</em> via the teleporter which is a huge limitation,
especially given how players respawn in waves. This new level 3
teleporter wouldn’t have that problem, allowing engineers to better
support their team much better.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I feel the final teleporter upgrade is somewhat superfluous
as it’s only a 2 second difference from level 2 - 3. This fixes
that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> dispensers heal in bursts instead of
continuously (40 / 60 / 80 based on level) every 4 seconds. (the time
between bursts is independent to each player)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I see this as a buff (although it’s technically not), as you
could run by a dispenser and instantly get the health boost, similar to
health packs, instead of having to wait around. I think this allows the
engineer to support their team a lot better.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the overall heal rate is still the same, so it still
won’t have a chance of outdoing a medic or anything crazy like
that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> buildings no longer have crit immunity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives more options to destroy buildings which adds more
counterplay and helps to balance out the above buffs. I see no reason
why the kritzkrieg or buff banner should be useless against sentries -
it’s arbitrary and unnecessarily restrictive.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An interesting quirk of this is that it allows pyros to flare
punch buildings, similar to enemy pyros. I don't see this being very
impactful as sentries usually zone pyros out.</p></li>
<li><p>Another oddity is that sappers are also buildings, and thus can
be one shot with a crit wrench swing – but again, it’s extremely
niche.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> sentries have an added 0.15 second delay
before they start shooting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enables you to maybe not instantly die if you turn a corner and
there's a sentry you didn't know was there, and makes corner peeking the
gun a little easier and less tedious.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> the panic attack is no longer equipable</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon’s concept doesn’t really vibe with engineers – it’s
pretty poor as a primary weapon. Right now it can sort of work, but <a
href="#panic-attack"><u>especially after it's reworked</u></a>, it’s
almost always better to use stock.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think there’s a way to make it work on an engineer
without compromising its identity, so just cutting it from his arsenal
is the best option.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pomson-6000">Pomson 6000</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 80% faster projectile speed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 25% faster reload speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes this not suck to the point of being worse than the rescue
ranger for combat.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> penetrates through players, dealing mini
crits</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a unique upside that helps out is low damage output
(especially at mid to long range) to help make it usable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> does not grain uber or cloak</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="widowmaker">Widowmaker</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> max damage per shot: 90 → 105 (per pellet
base damage: 6 → 7)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon severely cripple’s your ability to sustain your
buildings and perform your class role, and the benefits it provides are
a bit more situational than I think most people realize. How often do
you <em>really</em> use more than 6 shots in a single fight? it’s just
not worth the gamble the vast majority of the time.</p></li>
<li><p>This damage buff makes it on par with the scattergun, which
should help to offset the risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> shooting disguised spies will restore
metal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This weapon is already so risky to spy check with, so such a
harsh punishment for catching out a spy in spite of that isn’t
warranted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed +10% damage to sentry’s target</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This stat is both extremely insignificant, and a poor choice for
the widowmaker. the weapon forces you to shift resources away from your
buildings towards your own combat potential, so giving a bonus in
conjunction with your sentry doesn’t really fit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrangler">Wrangler</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p>Heavily inspired by <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toxY8lHfs30"><u>uncle dane’s
suggestions</u></a>, with some modification</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> sentry firing speed: +100% (minis) / +67%
(level 1) / +50% (level 2+) → +150% (all)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because the aim assist has been removed (see below), I think
having an even stronger damage increase is deserved since it really
demands a lot of the engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>Having different firing speed bonuses for different sentry levels
is unnecessary and overcomplicated, so having a consistent bonus just
streamlines things.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed delay to reactivate auto aim</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With these weapon’s new focus on the offensive potential, having
this long delay isn’t really necessary, and it prevents the engine from
using the wrangler in conjunction with their other weapons.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 80% less self damage from sentries (knockback
is identical)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes sentry jumping more viable since it now doesn’t remove half
of the engie’s health. this is balanced because it still has a high cost
(building a sentry) and is very risky (engie is weaker when alone, and
has to leave their buildings at risk)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed sentry shield (66% resistance) while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>making your sentry have up to 651 effective health is extremely
powerful, and would need a massive cost to the engineer to make it
balanced. Currently, the only cost is that you need to aim your gun, but
that is pretty insignificant compared to tripling the durability of your
sentry, especially considering the generous aim assist.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if it was balanced, I'm not sure it would be healthy for the
game as it requires a massive effort to destroy and slows down matches
significantly.</p></li>
<li><p>I also agree with uncle dane that this doesn't really fit the
theme of the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed sentry aim assist</p>
<ul>
<li><p>doubling your sentries damage for the cost of manual aiming
should require the engie to actually aim. This aim assist is so generous
that it removes most of the execution barrier, so this change should
increase the skill ceiling for this weapon significantly.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, this would let you manually aim the rockets at the people's
feet to combo them, which is a cool silver lining and further adds to
the skill ceiling.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-circuit">Short CIrcuit</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in both 6s and highlander</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> energy ball cost: 65 → 25</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I've given these weapons a significant execution cost, so it’s
more than fair to reduce the resource cost to compensate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 80% smaller energy ball size</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Airblast is fair because it requires precise timing, which gives
the opponent some counterplay (you can space out your shots to throw off
the pyro's timing). The short circuit swapping the timing requirement
for a metal cost removes most of that counterplay – there’s not much you
can do to bypass an engie who manages their metal effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>It's also pretty overpowered when you can get unlimited metal
from the payload, allowing the engie to spam it.</p></li>
<li><p>making the energy ball smaller gives the short circuit, like
airblast, counterplay. projectile classes can shoot the projectile at a
weird angle to avoid the energy ball.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed primary fire. the energy ball now is
the primary fire</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The primary fire is currently too weak to be of any use. However,
I feel it can’t really be buffed, because it would largely invalidate
the pistol’s self defense role. To keep the weapon’s identity more
cohesive, I think just removing the primary fire is the best course of
action.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="texas-instrument">★ Texas Instrument</h2>

from the removal of the wrangler’s shield, while actually being

<ul>
<li><p>increases the building’s speed (firing speed / heal &amp; ammo
rate / recharge time) by 40% for 15 seconds</p></li>
<li><p>grants the building a shield (like the wrangler) with 20% damage
resistance</p></li>
<li><p>boosting a building costs 150 metal</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jag">Jag</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> building construction rate: +30% → +50%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As shown by this clip, the jag’s faster speed is honestly mostly
placebo – <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxCJ76WZd-c&amp;t=109s"><u>the
difference only comes out to a couple seconds</u></a>. granted, this
isn’t nothing, but it’s not impactful enough to distinguish it from the
stock wrench.</p></li>
<li><p>exaggerating the upside should make it more significant, making
the jag more interesting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> repair rate: -20% → -40%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The jag is meant to be worse at keeping buildings up, but that
currently only applies to sappers; <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxCJ76WZd-c&amp;t=218s"><u>it
usually takes the same number of hits to repair most
things</u></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>granted, the jag is slightly worse at dealing with damage over
time, but this isn't a significant enough downside – the jag is only
worse if there’s a competent spy on the enemy team. This repair nerf is
always relevant, and serves as a heavy tradeoff compared to
stock.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -33% damage now applies to players, not just
sappers, and is rounded to 40</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This barely changes anything, only lowering the already pitiful
damage to players (52 → 40). However, having two different damage
penalties is a little clunky, so combining them just makes the
description a lot more streamlined.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="southern-hospitality">Southern Hospitality</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In its current form, it’s boring and too similar to stock. I
think what they were going for is a more defensive wrench (counters
spies, but weak to pyros if you’re roaming), but the downsides and
upsides are too inconsequential to make a huge difference for either
playstyle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +250% dispenser range</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there should probably be a little circle on the ground to
indicate the radius.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of people have suggested this stat, and I quite like it.
It's a good way to make this wrench better at defending in a way that’s
supportive, and doesn’t slow the game down. it also really fits with the
weapon’s theme of “hospitality”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed 20% fire vulnerability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is more or less a nothing stat. engineers can usually just
zone pyros out with their sentry. even if they get hit by a flare or
something, 20% isn’t a huge difference. removed for simplicity, and
replaced with the more impactful downside below.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> movement speed on user: -12% (300hu/s →
264hu/s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is the same speed as a demoman. it limits the engineer’s
ability to move around the map, and fits the solitary play style this
wrench is meant for.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="industrial-might">★ Industrial Might</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A new wrench for engineers.</p></li>
<li><p>Sentry is replaced with <strong>factory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>factories spawn MvM bots for your team</p></li>
<li><p>bots are constructed every 9 / 6 / 3 seconds (based on level), up
to a maximum of 2 / 3 / 4 bots at once.</p></li>
<li><p>The factory will build classes in a preset order (the same as the
class list), and always with a stock loadout.</p></li>
<li><p>One bot will always stay behind to guard the factory. The rest
will wait until a full squad of 1 / 2 / 3 bots is ready, and then will
proceed to the objective together.</p></li>
<li><p>bots are unable to cap objectives, they can only guard
them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This wrench offers a completely different playstyle to senties.
factories are much more prone to getting rushed down, and require
constant attention, but can potentially have great offensive potential
if not dealt with.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handy-pardner">★ Handy Pardner</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A new PDA. i didn’t come up with this idea, this is basically the
engiepads mod. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF4oPkmWBkI"><u>This</u> <u>video
demonstrates how they would work</u></a>, and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X87Y3QRN2Ts&amp;t=210s"><u>this
video shows some</u> <u>in-game</u> <u>applications from the balance
mod</u></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> teleporter entrance → <strong>speed
pad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>grants a 3 second speed boost to teammates that walk over
it.</p></li>
<li><p>has a cooldown of 1.5s / 0.5s / 0s (based on level).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> teleporter exit → <strong>jump
pad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>grants a massive boost to jump height to teammates standing on
it, which increases even further if you are crouching.</p></li>
<li><p>it has a cooldown of 1.5s / 0.5s / 0s (based on level)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The two pads aren’t linked like teleporters are. so healing /
sapping one won’t affect the other, and their cooldowns are independent
of one another.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I feel this is vital to making engineers work better in a more
aggressive class without encroaching on his signature defensive
capabilities. It's a great option for situations where teleporters
usually aren’t very useful, like 5cp or last point holds. It also opens
up a ton of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>One difference from the balance mod is that you must have both a
speed pad and a jump pad. I feel a 2nd speed pad would be more versatile
and useful than a jump pad the vast majority of the time. without this
restriction, many would just never use the jump pad, which would be a
shame. requiring use of both a speed and jump pad forces the engineer to
be more creative.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="medic">Medic</h1>
<p>Medic is mostly good, and has an okay-ish playstyle variety (the
mediguns are very distinct), and ubercharge is great for the flow of the
game. however there’s one major problem:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Medic’s meta is stale:</strong> the primary and melee
slots pretty much have 1 definitive option</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-wide-changes-7">Class Wide Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> melee kills now heal the medic for 2x the
overkill damage, which can overheal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this allows melee damage to help medic’s survivability in a
meaningful way, and it makes damage penalties on utility melees more
significant (less damage = less healing &amp; reduced
survivability)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> syringe projectiles fall 50% slower</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> syringe guns now reload passively</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gives the syringe guns extra general applicability with less
commitment and increased range, similar to the crossbow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> syringe gun base damage: 10 → 15</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +100% firing speed (9.5/s → 19/s) (0.26s per
burst)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> syringe guns now shoot in a single burst of 5
before reloading.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>much less overall dps, but with much greater burst damage. This
is better suited to medicine, because you should be on your medigun most
of the time doing your class’ primary function, only briefly switching
to your primary. Having a weapon with a constant rate of fire like the
current syringe guns basically forces them to be either bad (no utility,
poor self defense) or overpowered (medic can defend themselves caught
out alone).</p></li>
<li><p>Having this limited burst fire makes it bad for 1v1 engagements
where it’s the only source of damage, so alone medic is still easy
pickings. However, the increased burst damage makes it a decent
<em>additional</em> source of damage alongside your team, like for
finishing off injured targets.</p></li>
<li><p>it’s also good to go for a few popshots to buff up your regen
(see below stat)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> base regen rate: 3h/s → 1/hs. however, it can
scale up to 5h/s by dealing 200 damage (+0.02h/s per 1 damage). this
regen bonus degrades at a rate of 0.16h/s² (25s total)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes damaging weapons a lot more useful for survivability
(without making medic’s combat potential too strong), since they can
boost regen.</p></li>
<li><p>It also opens up an interesting risk reward dynamic, where
injured medics might want to try and take risks to deal damage in order
to regenerate faster.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> mediguns can’t overheal other medics</p>
<ul>
<li><p>key word: mediguns. you can now use the <a
href="#overdose"><u>overdose</u></a> for this purpose</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t really affect casual so much because the medics will
usually spread out, but in competitive, 2 medics is a really powerful
strategy that I think needs to be honed in.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, I feel that having 2 medics makes the game a little
less exciting, because it makes <em>the</em> med pick into just
<em>a</em> med pick, not nearly as impactful. so i’d like to discourage
that in competitive, or at least relegate it to more of a situational
tactic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> uber build rate is halved when healing
patients that <em>any</em> overheal, rather than only those above 142.5%
health.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This mechanic is really important for encouraging medics to help
the <em>team</em> rather than just the one friend they're on call with.
but sometimes, it isn’t as effective a deterrent as it should be. if
you’re in combat, your patient will probably be below 142.5% health
anyways, so the penalty won’t affect you very much.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the quickfix can completely ignore this penalty because of
its reduced maximum overheal. this change prevents that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I could apply this change <em>just</em> to the quickfix, but that
feels a little clunky to me. how do you write the stat text for that in
a way that a new player could understand? besides, pocketing is sort of
a problem in general, so I feel making this a universal change is
warranted.</p></li>

<h2 id="syringe-gun">Syringe Gun</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>no direct changes, but <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>syringe
guns and regen have been reworked, see class wide changes</u></a>. This
makes the syringe gun’s higher damage genuinely useful, as it can serve
as an effective finisher against injured enemies, and can bolster the
medic’s regen rate more effectively than the other primaries.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blutsauger">Blutsauger</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>syringe guns are

<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> healing on hit: 3 → 12</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I'd say heal on hit is a pretty good way to have a survivability
syringe gun, but because there’s fewer syringes being shot, it needs to
be increased. with this, the medic could heal a max of 60 health in a
burst. That might sound like a lot, but that’s only if all 5 syringes
hit with max ramp up, so typically you’d be healing ~40, which I'd say
is fair.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed penalty to passive healing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it’s kind of a nothing stat as you’ll be on your medigun most of
the time anyways, and it doesn’t fit the weapon’s theme of
survivability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 400% longer reload time (1.3s → 5.2s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This severely limits its damage output. so you’re trading self
defense and increased regen (<a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>see
class wide changes</u></a>) for instant healing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>syringe guns now reload

</ul>
<h2 id="overdose">Overdose</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>syringe guns are
reworked, see class wide changes</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> syringes heal teammates for 12 health per
syringe (affected by ramp up and falloff), which can overheal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a decent sidegrade to the crossbow. The healing isn’t as
strong and is more hampered by range, but unlike the crossbow, it can
overheal.</p></li>
<li><p>This is also the only way a medic can overhear another
medic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed speed boost based on ubercharge while
active</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don't like this upside in concept, since if it was buffed to be
on par with the crossbow, it would allow medic to escape too easily
without an added risk like the escape plan.</p></li>
<li><p>I also feel it doesn’t fit the theme of the weapon particularly
well, so it’s replaced with an entirely new upside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> base damage: 13 → 7 (-42%)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>gives it a significant downside compared to stock. The vanilla
damage penalty is barely noticeable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crusaders-crossbow">Crusader’s Crossbow</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> heals disguised spies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>spy checking is now delegated to syringe guns, as that gives them
a unique way to enhance medic's survivability while keeping medic weak
in a 1v1 scenario. The crossbow isn't really meant for spy checking
anyways and has so many other things going for it, so this is a
relatively minor nerf.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vaccinator">Vaccinator</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Banned in 6s</p></li>
<li><p>For casual, this is the single strongest item in the game in my
opinion. It's also very unfun to fight casually <em>and</em>
competitive, which i suspect would be the case even if it was more
balanced. It's really frustrating to pick classes, as an ambush from
them can be completely nullified by a bubble that took 6-8s to charge.
In addition, it also tends to slow the game down because it’s really
good for survivability, but poor for actually pushing.</p></li>
<li><p>On the flip side however, I actually really like the multiple
ubers this has. as overpowered as it is, you need to be <em>good</em> to
get much use out of it. The vaccinator demands a lot of improvisation
and awareness out of medicine, raising the skill ceiling drastically,
which is great.</p></li>
<li><p>Basically, this needs an entirely reworked design that’s balanced
and fun to fight while keeping the multiple ubers. I really like <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7DwKq5Vg1E&amp;t=734s"><u>Theory
Y’s idea</u></a> to shift to more offensive ubers as it does just that,
so I stole it and made some minor modifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +60% uber duration (2.5s → 4s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This also allows vaccinator medics to build up big pushes more
effectively (max 16s duration with all 4 bubbles) which is good because
it suits the reworked ubers and helps power through strongholds to break
stalemates like the other mediguns.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> bullet resistance → <strong>shield
bubble</strong>: 35% damage resistance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is low enough that the medic and their pocket will actually
be killable.</p></li>
<li><p>i chose to discard the crit resistance because <a
href="#replace-damage-resvuln"><u>I'm not a fan of it in
general</u></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> blast resistance → <strong>speed
bubble</strong>: +20% movement speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows for interesting plays, and opens up a lot of ubersaw
potential, but there’s quite a lot of risk to this as you and your
pocket will still be somewhat vulnerable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> fire resistance → <strong>haste
bubble</strong>: +40% firing speed AND +40% switch speed. automatic
weapons will get the firing speed increase, the rest will get the reload
speed increase.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a good offensive bubble because it doesn’t infringe on
what the kritzkrieg does, and is useful to all classes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed 66% faster uber build rate (6s per
bubble → 10s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>making bubbles last slightly longer but charge slightly slower
punishes the medic more harshly for misusing them, and helps to balance
out the increased duration (as Theory Y points out, this keeps the
uptime almost the same).</p></li>
<li><p>it also makes tracking uber of a vaccinator medic more possible
since it has the same build rate as stock, and pops bubbles less
frequently.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed passive resistance to the currently
selected damage type</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this wouldn’t make sense with the reworked ubers obviously, but
it’s also a pretty egregious stat in my eyes because it undermines the
entire playstyle of the vaccinator. Having many fast charging, but
significantly weaker ubers means you have to make quick decisions and
pop ubers more liberally to be effective. This passive resistance that
reduces the need to pop bubbles completely contradicts that.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the actual effect this has is usually negligible
(except against quickscopes, <a href="#class-wide-changes"><u>but
those deal increased damage now so they’d still be able to kill
anyways</u></a>). This stat is therefore redundant.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quick-fix">Quick-Fix</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a difficult weapon to fix. it’s clearly the worst medigun
in casual while simultaneously being banned in 6s for very good
reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, you can build uber at max rate with this even while
pocketing a single player because of the overheal penalty, but <a
href="#quick-fix"><u>uber now builds slower on</u> <em><u>any</u></em>
<u>overheating</u></a> so this no longer happens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> no flashing penalty; this medigun instantly
switches heal targets</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is designed to buff the quickfix specifically in 12v12 where
it is too weak. it’s more effective the more players there are. you’ll
also be healing up targets to full fast – so you’ll be switching targets
more often, meaning you can benefit a lot from this buff.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 10% faster build rate → 50% faster (36s →
20s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I believe having the quick fix charge faster than the other
mediguns is crucial to giving it a more active playstyle. you can’t wait
around for the enemy medic’s uber because it’s <em>much</em> stronger.
instead, you have to use your pop first to try and catch them out and
press your advantage before they get theirs.</p></li>
<li><p>This also helps it out in casual comparison to 6s, because
there’s more players to build off of, allowing you to exploit the faster
buildrate more.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -50% ubercharge duration (8s → 4s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is to compensate for the faster build rate (see
above)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> can only follow blast jumping teammates when
above half health</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In casual, this is great fun. but it’s a big problem for
competition because it gives the medic an escape tool at basically zero
cost. In a coordinated environment, a teammate will always be there to
allow the medic to escape.</p></li>
<li><p>This should fix that, while not really affecting casualness as
medics can usually only use this to jump into a fight, not to
escape.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonesaw">Bonesaw</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>no direct changes, but <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>medic
melees now heal on kill, and regeneration is reworked to scale with
damage</u></a>. both of these make the bonesaw’s higher damage a lot
more useful for survivability.</p></li>
<li><p>I still doubt these changes would lead experienced medics to opt
for the bonesaw, but it atleast makes it serviceable, especially for new
players.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vita-saw">Vita-Saw</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>medic melees now
heal on kill, and regeneration is reworked to scale with
damage</u></a></p></li>
<li><p>Even ignoring how horribly it's balanced, this weapon's whole
design of making dying as a medic less punishing is unhealthy for the
game as it makes the medic pick easier and less important, which is just
less exciting. This needs a complete rework.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⭯)</strong> organs are consumed during uber to increase
the duration by 25% (+2s, or +1s on vacc), with a visual effect to
indicate the longer uber to enemies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This boosts medic’s uber, but in a different way from the ubersaw
(frequency vs duration) that changes how you play. This is a much better
utility because it’s fun to use (even stronger ubers, and doesn’t
require you to die), and it makes the game more exciting (higher
risk/reward).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> 50% slower swing speed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes exploiting bad players to get a 2nd or 3rd swing much
more difficult, while not affecting the time for a single swing much. I
think this is fair, since the usual risk that keeps this balanced
doesn’t really apply when you’re fighting a gibus spy with 10 hours in
the game.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uber-saw">Uber-Saw</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>this weapon is indirectly nerfed because <a
href="#class-wide-changes-4"><u>you won’t gain uber</u></a> from
disguised spies</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> swing speed: -20% → -50%</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes exploiting bad players to get a 2nd or 3rd swing much
more difficult, while not affecting the time for a single swing much. I
think this is more than fair. The usual risk that keeps this balanced
doesn’t really apply when you’re fighting a gibus spy with 10 hours in
the game, and good players won’t give you an opportunity for more than 1
swing anyways.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> does not heal on kill</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This forces medic to make a sacrifice to survivability (similar
to the vitasaw’s health penalty), which reinforces the high risk high
reward playstyle of the weapon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="amputator">Amputator</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>note that <a href="#class-wide-changes-7"><u>medic melees deal 75

<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> +42% healing from taunt: 105 (23.8hp/s) → 150
(34hp/s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The taunt is a really unique strategy, and it deserves to be more
practical.</p></li>
<li><p>i prefer strengthening the healing as opposed to allowing the
taunt to be canceled like some others have suggested. keeping the action
high risk is more interesting and keeps the game moving
forward.</p></li>
<li><p>in most situations, you can actually heal people faster with
stock and the crossbow, which a large part of what makes the taunt
almost never a good option. increasing the heal rate should alleviate
this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> removed faster regen rate while
active</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> damage: 60 → 40 (-20% → -47.6%)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A new melee for medic that opens up some interesting combat
potential</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> hitting an enemy will debuff them for 15
seconds. healing they recieve during the duration will instead damage
them. it also allows them to be targeted by mediguns.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This opens up some interesting combat potential for medic,
allowing you to turn your supportive capability into damage. granted,
the stock medigun will only deal 24 dps which isn’t crazy, but when the
effect is combined with a quickfix uber, the overdose, crusader's
crossbow, or even the amputator, there’s some potential there.</p></li>
<li><p>but this is very risky since you have to get a melee swing off
first. Not to mention, engaging in combat as a medic is generally ill
advised. so it’s definitely a very situational, but fun,
unlock.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> damage: 65 → 15</p>

<li><p>an appropriate downside that compliments the weapon’s debuff very
nicely. you are supposed to kill enemies with healing, not by doing

<h2 id="panic-attack">Panic Attack</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>balanced, but too similar to stock. it needs to change how you
play more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> this weapon reloads passively while
stowed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> 35% faster reload speed (1s → 0.65s)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>leans into the idea of a combo shotgun that the faster switch
speed seems to imply – you don’t have to spend time reloading.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> removed increasing spread on successive
shots</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this doesn’t really affect much of anything. at the range where
the spread will make a real difference, a shotgun is only going to be
dealing chip damage anyways, so the penalty is negligible.</p></li>
<li><p>not to mention, it’s so quick to reset the spread. even just the
time you take to line up a shot is often enough.</p></li>
<li><p>The replacement downside below is a very extreme, but effective
way to disincentive prolonged use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> -5 clip size</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This ramps the idea of successive shots becoming less effective
up to 11: it’s literally incapable of sustained fire. It also makes it
radically different from stock. it has superior damage and speed, but
doesn’t stand on its own.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reserve-shooter">Reserve Shooter</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s banned in 6s and Highlander because it’s way too strong at
denying bombs, which slows down games.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> now mini crits enemies after they’ve been
airblasted <em>out of the air.</em> so airblasting someone off the
ground won’t work – you have to either airblast them away after they
explosive jump, or airblast them twice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives the reserve shooter better use on pyro by allowing
them to combo with airblast, but to a limited degree. I think this is a
fair compromise between the glory days of pre jungle inferno and the
game currently.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> now only crits enemies launched airborne by
you or your team, not those who are rocket jumping. hitting an airshot
rocket also counts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This heavily nerfs the reserve shooter’s capacity to deny bombs,
which should get it unbanned. but it’s still pretty good for most
soldiers who use it as a combo tool.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b.a.s.e-jumper">B.A.S.E Jumper</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s banned in 6s because it can allow a soldier or demo to hover
over mid indefinitely, allowing them to spam down safely, outside the
effective range of the standard 6s comp. in casual though, it’s
generally just kinda bad – a competent sniper basically forces you to
switch loadouts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> no longer halts horizontal momentum after
deployment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives it some application for interesting rocket jumps,
allowing a skilled user to fly more quickly and offset its weakness
against hitscan. I believe this would be fair since your movement path
will still be very predictable (low air control).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> demoknight can now deploy the base jumper
while charging</p>
<ul>
<li><p>makes this item actually useful for demoknights. i doubt you
could do anything too crazy with it to surpass the booties but it'd be
another fun option.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠝)</strong> can be redeployed while in the air 0.8s after
dropping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows you to throw off the timing of people trying to shoot
you out of the sky, and adds some counterplay to the sniper
matchup.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>🠟)</strong> taking 50 damage <em>or</em> flying into a
wall at high speed will cause the parachute to fail, and be unable to be
redeployed until you hit the ground again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there should probably be a hud element that indicates the
remaining health of the parachute.</p></li>
<li><p>This prevents hovering over mid and spamming down in 6s, as
someone who does this can get focused down and shot out of the sky, even
with a pistol.</p></li>
<li><p>it also hones in the buff to horizontal speed, as you have to be
careful not to hit any walls if you're trying to gain a lot of speed to

<p>Many have observed how <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj6duP3Ynt0"><u>TF2 can be
deceptively hard to get better at if you're new</u></a>. The in-game
resources for learning are very lackluster, forcing a reliance on
community created guides that you won’t know about until you’re already
deep into the game. Additionally, the game’s wide array of unlockable
items massively amplifies the amount of things a new player has to
learn; thus making the game a lot less accessible than it could be. The
following changes are my solutions to those problems.</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Can only be played by accounts below level 8.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a new player can still skip right to casual at any time, but they
will be guided towards this mode</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only stock items are allowed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you also won’t get random item drops in this mode</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only 5 maps, one for each casual gamemode.</p></li>

<h2 id="item-progression-rework">Item Progression Rework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>random item drops will give you the more straightforward unlocks
when you’re new:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>items should be in 3 tiers of complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>beginner</strong>: always has a chance to drop</p></li>
<li><p><strong>intermediate:</strong> only level 8+</p></li>
<li><p><strong>advanced:</strong> only level 15+</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GrQ1i5F.png"><u>list of item
tiers</u></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>all of the additional items i’ve added would probably be in the
advanced tier, since they are all pretty complicated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This makes it easier for new players to start using the
unlockables they do get. it also allows for the progression of ideas by
ordering the unlocks. For example, it's a lot easier to understand the
scorch shot and detonator if you’ve unlocked the flare gun
first.</p></li>
<li><p>these tiers wouldn’t be visible in any way.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>specific items can be acquired by completing <a
href="#missions"><u>missions</u></a>, allowing you to bypass the random
drop system completely</p></li>
<li><p>you’ll be more likely to acquire items for the class you were
playing</p></li>
<li><p>you’ll never get duplicates until you have everything</p>
<ul>
<li><p>maybe the drop rate should be slightly reduced to counterbalance
this</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missions">★ Missions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>These are single player maps built into the game.</p></li>
<li><p>features unique gameplay scenarios, many of which teach a
specific unlockable weapon (or gameplay mechanic) and will then reward
you with it afterward</p>
<ul>
<li><p>parkour courses</p></li>
<li><p>stealth heists</p></li>
<li><p>boss battles</p></li>
<li><p>survival missions</p></li>
<li><p>combat arenas</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they will usually force you into a preset class and loadout, but
more advanced missions might give you some options</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>missions are divided into 4 tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>beginner</strong>: always available</p></li>
<li><p><strong>intermediate</strong>: level 8+ only</p></li>
<li><p><strong>advanced</strong>: level 15+ only</p></li>
<li><p><strong>expert</strong>: level 25+ only</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some of these expert missions won’t really be tutorials at all,
just pure gameplay. the ones that are will teach an advanced mechanic
(bhoping, chaining rockets, airblast combos, ext)</p></li>
<li><p>instead of rewarding an item, they’ll unlock a contract that
requires you to make use of the mechanic you learned.</p></li>
<li><p>expert missions won’t be accessible until you’ve unlocked the
items that are used in it</p></li>

<h2 id="auto-balance">Auto Balance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>auto balance will never occur unless there’s a disparity of 3 or
more players. Otherwise, the matchmaking system will attempt to balance
the teams by adding new players to the team that’s down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For most people, getting switched teams in the middle of a game
is pretty undesirable, so I feel it should be reserved for extreme
cases.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>players will have the option to join the opposing team if it has
fewer players</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This essentially lets people volunteer for autobalance, allowing
those who don't mind the switch so much to take the place of people who
would be annoyed by it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>players who are in a party will never be auto balanced, unless
there’s no one else available</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This prevents parties from being separated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>auto balance will prioritize those who have less time in the
current match. so if you’ve just joined, you are more likely to get auto
balanced than someone who has been playing the entire round.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>getting auto balanced at the start of a game usually isn’t a big
deal because you’re not invested in the game yet, so most people don’t
mind it so much</p></li>
<li><p>This also helps to prevent the scenario of getting auto balanced
to the losing team right before the game ends.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="competitive">Competitive</h1>
<p>The goal is to have it be like a subset of casual. so there won’t be
anything you aren’t already familiar with</p>
<h2 id="ruleset">Ruleset</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>6v6, no class limits or weapon bans weapon bans</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li><p>fewer maps – some don’t really work well in 6v6</p>
<ul>
<li><p>longer maps like swiftwater should be cut</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the enforced graphics upgrade is removed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is completely unnecessary for competitive integrity, and it
walks out a lot of people from playing competitive</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ranking-matchmaking">Ranking &amp; Matchmaking</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of having 13 ranks, it’s there’s now numerical levels
that progress infinitely, with each game moving you up or down a single
level.</p></li>
<li><p>Players split into 5 different divisions based on rank:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wood</strong> (1-20)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copper</strong> (21-40)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iron</strong> (41-60)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Platinum</strong> (61-80)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Australium</strong> (81-100)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenger I</strong> (101-120)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenger II</strong> (121-140)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>challenger divisions will endlessly repeat every 20
levels</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can only be matched with players who are in the same division
as you. Ideally, the system will try to put you with players who are as
close in level as possible, but that may not always be
possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abandonments">Abandonments</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Abandons won’t kick everyone out of the match before the game has
actually started – instead, if you pause and look for a new person. Once
the lobby is up to 12 players, it’ll require everyone to prepare to
start the game again, and those who fail to do so within 60 seconds will
be kicked.</p></li>
<li><p>Abandonments mid match:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The abandoner will be sent down 6 levels, and they’ll be required
to wait 3+ hours before they can queue for competition again.</p></li>
<li><p>For everyone else, the game will pause and the matchmaking system
will look for a new player to fill the gap. once the new player joins,
the game will only resume once everyone has readied up</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Additionally, all players will be moved back to the previous
point or their spawn room, with ubercharge and the like reset, but
objective progress for the round will remain as is.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So for example if your team is attacking last on 5cp, the
defending team will be moved to their spawn room, and the attacking team
will be moved to 4th.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This ‘reset’ aims to minimize the impact of the abandoner by as
much as possible.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="party-queue">Party Queue</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can queue up for competitive in a party</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll be queued based on the median rank of all players in the
party</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need a full party – the matchmaking system will ensure
that both teams have the same number and size of party</p>
<ul>
<li><p>so if you’re in a 3 person party for instance, you’ll be queued
with and against other parties of 3, to keep it fair</p></li>
<li><p>this should be prompted to the you the first time you open the
competitive menu</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unranked-practice">Unranked Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>When you play competitively, you can tick a box that says ‘play
unranked,’ which can allow you to queue for 6s without ranks being
affected. obviously when doing this you’ll only be queued with other
players who are also playing unranked AND who are in the same division
as you</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allowing people to practice 6s without ranked is important to
making competitive accessible. Removing the stakes makes it a lot less
daunting to try out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accessing-competitive">Accessing Competitive</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To play competitive, you must be at least casual level 15 and
must have a premium account</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Having a requirement of level 15 instead of level 3 helps to
prevent smurfing</p></li>
<li><p>There’s no point to having a competitive pass. I think requiring
players to spend some money before playing is a good idea to limit
smurfing, but it’s better to let players spend that money on a hat or
something they actually care about.</p></li>
<li><p>When you first start playing competitively, you’ll start at 1/3th
of your casual level, but no further than level 20.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Casual level 15 → comp level 5</p></li>
<li><p>Casual level 50 → comp level 17</p></li>
<li><p>Casual level 999 → comp level 20</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If someone has played a lot of casual, they are probably pretty
skilled already and should be sent out of the wood division quicker.
This reduces the amount of steamrolls that would otherwise occur in wood
division.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="mann-vs-machine">Mann vs Machine</h1>
<p>Will be completely reworked – the gameplay is quite flawed in my
opinion. I'm confident that if random drops from missions were removed,
a huge majority of the player base would stop playing.</p>
<h1 id="payload">Payload</h1>
<p>Payload is <em>the</em> staple casual mode – usually hailed as the
best, and it also sees play in Highlander. However, I'm not convinced
it’s always ideal. especially for 6s, it has some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pushing the cart is boring</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s lot slower than the other objectives, and it really limits
the ability of offense to stretch their advantage because some players
have to stay behind to babysit the cart</p></li>
<li><p>This particularly affects scout, see <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Rzp2tNd7s&amp;t=326s"><u>b4nny
in Highlander</u></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Defense is encouraged to essentially stalemate the
game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Situations where neither team can push forward are boring whether
it’s the stated objective or not – defense having little incentive to
push the cart makes the gameplay much less dynamic and
strategic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Payload is very static compared to other competitive
modes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You’re either always attacking or always defending. there’s less
decisions to make on when to hold back or to push forward, and therefore
less depth – not good for a competitive mode.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cart-rework">Cart Rework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>instead of moving at a constant speed of 50 / 70 / 90hu/s, the
cart accelerates at 5hu/s² per person (no 3 person cap) up to a max
speed of 150hu/s. after being unattended for 5 seconds, the cart
decelerates at 3hu/s² (50s to stop from max speed)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows the attacking team to make headway without having to
leave people at the cart at all times, allowing them to be more
aggressive.</p></li>
<li><p>making the max speed higher is necessary to compensate for the
time it takes to accelerate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The cart can now be pushed by the defenders – but it no longer
rolls back on its own. defenders push the cart at half the speed of
attackers (2.5hu/s² per person)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this might seem broken, but keep in mind that if the cart has
already accelerated, it’s going to take a long time to slow
down</p></li>
<li><p>This encourages the defense to be more aggressive and push up as
far as possible. This makes the optimal defense more dynamic and
interesting compared to building 6 sentries last.</p></li>
<li><p>the cart still can’t be rolled back past checkpoints.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="control-points">Control Points</h1>
<p>5CP is a very strategic mode due to its back and forth nature, and is
the standard for competition as a result. However, its glaring issue is
that it’s often very prone to stalemates, where after winning the
midfight, neither team has any incentive to push. these changes are
heavily inspired by <a
href="https://i.imgur.com/ZxnksJa.png"><u>Construction Zombie’s
comment</u></a> on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8f-lYFMIYM"><u>this
video</u></a></p>
<h2 id="scoring-rework">Scoring Rework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>capping mid grants <strong>1 point</strong></p></li>
<li><p>capping last grant's <strong>2 points</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the first team to <strong>4 points</strong> wins</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This making timeouts give half the reward greatly incentises the
winning team to try and push all the way to last, as the reward greatly
offsets the risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="timer-rework">Timer Rework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>the timer doesn’t start until mid is captured</p></li>
<li><p>each time mid changes hands, the time is reset to <strong>4
minutes</strong></p></li>
<li><p>capping 4th will reward an additional <strong>2
minutes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a reasonable amount of time to push – a 10 minute timer
that resets every point barely creates any urgency. That's just asking
both teams to wait around for 10 minutes to try and sac for an important
pick, which is boring.</p></li>
<li><p>This stricter timer means you don’t have all day to just sit and
wait for a med pick, it’s now or never. This pushes teams to make more
risky plays, and keeps the game fast paced and exciting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>capping any point other than mid won’t reset the timer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>only resetting the timer on mid prevents the winning team from
purposely giving up 4th to stall for twice as long.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the time given by mid will reduce by <strong>1 minute</strong>
each recap (5 min → 4 min → 3 min → ext)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reduced time on mid recap prevents the game from going on
forever in the event that mid continuously changes hands.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="attack-defend">Attack Defend</h1>
<p>(TODO) pretty decent mode, but it doesn’t have the back and forth
dynamic, you’re either attacking or defending, which is less strategic.
cp_steel is a really interesting concept, but it’s really confusing for
new players and should probably be its own mode so it’s more easily
understood.</p>
<h1 id="capture-the-flag">Capture The Flag</h1>
<p>removed from the core casual rotation. It's very prone to stalemates,
and also splits up teams (some classes attack, others defend) which
makes the game worse (less teamwork). basically <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLKz7K6GEGA"><u>everything</u>
<u>ancle</u> <u>dane said</u></a>. while i do think the gamemode is
fundamentally pretty flawed, there’s some changes that can improve
it.</p>
<p>i understand that a lot of people enjoy ctf because of the endless
nature of it, giving an opportunity to just mess around. The <a
href="#deathmatch"><u>deathmatch</u></a> gamemode serves that
purpose.</p>
<p>Also, I do think a lot of the problems in ctf are indicative of the
really bad maps, where the intel room is <em>behind</em> the spawn room.
if every map was on the same level as landfall, the mode would be a lot
better.</p>
<h2 id="flag-returning">Flag Returning</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>your team's dropped flag will now instantly return to base on
touch, rather than forcing your entire team to defend it for 60
seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This allows you to spend less time defending your flag, reducing
the chances of the game stalling out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="three-rounds">Three Rounds</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>capping will instantly win the round, and the game is now a best
of 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives more opportunities for comebacks. if a team starts
getting spawn camped, it’ll only win a single round rather than the
entire game.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>+</strong> bread bite</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fits okay enough, and shouldn’t be broken</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>+</strong> brick</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fits well enough, and shouldn’t be too overpowered</p></li>
<li><p>might have a niche use, but i can’t see it beating out the
buffalo steak</p></li>

<li><p><strong>+</strong> walking stick</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fits well enough, and shouldn’t be too overpowered</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="knockout"><strong>★</strong> Knockout</h1>
<p>A new alternative gamemode. Heavily inspired by Diabotical, which has
the same mode. It's sort of a replacement for arena mode.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>the round is won when you get a team wipe (everyone is dead at
once)</p></li>
<li><p>when players die, they will leave a hologram (like MvM) and will
respawn <em>where they were</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unlike MvM, they can’t be revived by medics – you have to wait it
out.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The respawn time starts at 10 seconds, but each player’s respawn
increases by another 10 seconds each time they are killed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there’s no respawn waves like in regular TF2, it’s independent to
each player</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>there’s no spawn rooms</p></li>
<li><p>after 5 minutes, a battle royale style circle will start closing
in toward the center of the map, damaging those who are outside of
it</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is necessary to prevent games from going on forever
(especially with spies)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>you cannot change class or loadout once the round starts</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="juggernaut">★ Juggernaut</h1>
<p>A new alternative game mode based of the community mode <strong>vs
saxton hale</strong></p>
<h2 id="rules-1">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>each game is a single round, 12 mercenaries vs 1 robot
juggernaut</p></li>
<li><p>no respawning; the game ends once everyone on one team is
killed</p></li>
<li><p>The juggernaut is a robot version of a regular class.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they’re max health is 150% higher for each mercenary player</p>
<ul>
<li><p>12 players = 18x max health</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>they are larger, though not as big as giant robots in MvM</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they need to be small enough to fit through doorways</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>health packs heal them in proportion to their class’ normal base
health</p></li>
<li><p>if playing as a medic, reviving fallen mercenaries will reprogram
them and switch them to your team as a robot</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is needed, as otherwise medic would be useless as a
juggernaut</p></li>
<li><p>medic juggernauts also start with 100% ubercharge</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is needed to snowball the momentum from the first kill,
otherwise the bot would just instantly get obliterated by the 11 other
mercs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>reprogrammed robots will have retain their class’ normal health
and will be normal sized</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>there’s a 1% chance every round to spawn as <strong>saxton
hale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>400 base health</p></li>
<li><p>115% movement speed</p></li>
<li><p>200% jump height</p></li>
<li><p>75% resistance to knockback</p></li>
<li><p>can only use melee, deals 200 damage</p></li>
<li><p>crouching for 0.8s and then jumping will do a super jump (8x
height)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>fallen mercenary players can be revived by medics like in MvM,
but the time to revive will double each death.</p></li>
<li><p>after 15 minutes, a battle royale style circle will start closing
in toward the center of the map, damaging those outside of it</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="class-wars">★ Class Wars</h1>
<p>a new alternative gamemode, based on the community mode of the same
name.</p>
<h2 id="rules-2">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Each team can only be made up of a single class, which is chosen
at random.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After each round, the losing team’s class will change.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>can be played on any of the maps casually.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="duels">★ Duels</h1>
<p>a new alternative game mode, based on the MGE mod.</p>
<h2 id="rules-3">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>duels servers are made up of a number of different arenas, you’ll
choose one to join</p>
<ul>
<li><p>most are 1v1, with some 2v2 arenas</p></li>
<li><p>you’ll spawn in a safe lobby area where you can walk around and
see all the arenas.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>in each arena, 1v1 or 2v2 duels take place – first to 20
wins</p></li>
<li><p>the cloak and dagger is not allowed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is useless in a duel outside of stalling, so it’s
banned.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="deathmatch">★ Deathmatch</h1>
<p>a new alternative game mode, designed to better fill the need that
hightower / 2fort servers do currently.</p>
<h2 id="rules-4">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>there’s no objectives, the point is just to practice or hang
out</p></li>
<li><p>takes place on ctf and 5cp maps, or maybe even on custom
maps</p></li>
<li><p>respawn time is always 3 seconds (no respawn waves)</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="quality-of-life">Quality of Life</h1>
<p>Now obviously it would be great if tf3 was on a new, more optimized
and graphically impressive engine, and if every bug was fixed, so I'm
not going to go over those since they go without saying.</p>
<h2 id="better-options-menu">Better Options Menu</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>the ‘options’ and ‘advanced options’ should be unified under a
single menu.</p></li>
<li><p>the options should be searchable</p></li>
<li><p>the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRxFpr5Javg"><u>default options
are quite poor</u></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>default fov should be 90, not 60</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the view models should probably also be smaller</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>hit numbers should add up, not be individual</p></li>
<li><p>the default network settings should be improved</p></li>
<li><p>hit and kill sounds should be enabled by default</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gameplay-improvements">Gameplay Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>splash damage should curve around corners and uneven surfaces (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxRzQeaxlA"><u>explanation</u></a>).</p></li>
<li><p>the deadringer should always play a killsound.</p></li>
<li><p>When looking at a friendly engineer’s teleporter, the exit should
be highlighted so that you can get a better idea of exactly where it
will take you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this would work a lot better than the arrow that appears
currently.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>allow teammates to see the metal of friendly engineers when
looking at them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>allows you to play with to work better with your engineer’s by
allowing you to see when they need metal, or when you can take the ammo
pack for yourself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>picking up ammo while charging with the persian persuader should
always extend the charge duration without the need to hold right
click.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a really cool mechanic that I don't think you’d ever find
out about without watching solarlight. Having to hold the right click
doesn’t add anything, so I see no downside to making this more
accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>it might be a good idea to make holding right click
<em>prevent</em> the charge extension; you might want to do this when
there’s ammo boxes in front of your target that would prevent you from
critting them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>it would be neat if there was an option to enable a speed value
on your hud like in quake…</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usability-improvements">Usability Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>on spy, the viewmodel’s cloak visual should match the actual
cloak timing exactly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently, the cloak animation on the viewmodel happens slightly
faster than on the spy’s actual model in the world, so it can look like
you’re invisible from 1st person when you’re not.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the vaccinator should have control options to bind specific
bubbles to specific hotkeys instead of a cycle system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a lot better once you’re experienced, many vacc players
have to use clunky macros or scripts to get this effect
currently.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>there should be a subtle visual indication for when you are
bhopping</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's a bit difficult to learn this technique due to the lack of
feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a sound for when you’re bhopping with the rocket jumper,
but it’s quiet, and it’s only for one class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>all revolver crosshairs get bigger after the first shot (similar
to the ambassador) to indicate that it’s no longer perfectly
accurate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This change makes the mechanics of revolver spread more clear for
new players.</p></li>
<li><p>it would be good if the panic attack had a similar
effect</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>on weapons with a passive reload, the reload animation shouldn’t
stop when you switch to a different weapon and then switch back</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This makes it difficult to tell when the weapon is able to fire
because it’ll just be held normally after switching when it’s actually
still reloading.</p></li>
<li><p>This is most noticeable with the flare guns or the crusader's
crossbow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The syringe projectiles should have a subtle trail behind
them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When firing, it’s honestly difficult to even tell how close you
are because the syringes are so hard to see – I think it’s part of what
makes them feel so unwieldy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the engineer binds for taking out a building blueprint with a
single key should be available in the controls menu, without the need
for .cfg files.</p></li>
<li><p>there should be an option to allow bonk atomic punch to be usable
while in 1st person.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>going into 3rd person is cool, but it can feel a bit unwieldy and
sometimes makes it difficult to be precise with your movement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
